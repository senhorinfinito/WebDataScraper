Looking forward to them becoming international! definitely will use them whenever i get a chance."

Teh staff was extremely well mannered and courteus. The comfort was much better. The food served was decent, good in portion but still some room for improvemnt on the taste. The flight was very smooth and even though we hit a bit of turbulance mid air, but overall the pilots made it very smmoth. It is good to see once again the name Tata and Singapore together on an airline, makes you confident, comfortable auusured even before you board, would love to fly everytime. Thank you very much."

Ajay C wrote a review May 2019,50,Mumbai - New Delhi,Domestic,Premium Economy,Service Par Excellence,"I was given an upgrade of one class being my birthday month. Fortunately I was able to avail the upgrade. Fortunately, because just one person took the interest to make it happen. The others starting from the checkin counter to the counter at the gate didn't really care. The only person who ensured the upgrade was Tauseef (I hope I have the right name and spelling).
The service by the Flight Attendant in the Premium Economy, Sagar, was outstanding. He was humble, polite, attentive and discreet. The few minutes of interaction with Sagar made the flight truly worthwhile.
The passenger in the row on the other side of the aisle required assistance. Sagar was there for him too.
The snacks served had a appetising aroma and were delicious. I feel the portion size could be increased by at least another 15 to 20 percent."

SiddharthDhamija wrote a review May 2019,40,New Delhi - Bengaluru,Domestic,Premium Economy,Airlines started off very well but it seems that that they are not able to cope with the new load factor,"Till few weeks back, flying on Vistara was like a breeze of fresh air. However, it seems that with Jet Airways closing down, business travelers are all moving to Vistara and this is something which they are not able to cope up with on a daily basis. Quality of food is going down by the day; Airline staff is definitely not able to manage a sudden rush of people boarding the flight; crew on board looks stressed and over worked. My other issue with Vistara is that they don’t allow checking on to emergency row seat when one does a web check-in. Unlike all other airlines in the world who issue emergency row seats(and checking the physical state of passenger while boarding the flight) during web check-in, Vistara for some strange reasons does not allow this. What this means is that every time that I have to fly on Vistara, I need to be present 3 hours before my flight at the airport so that I can be lucky enough to get an emergency row seat in economy class."

AF1960yas wrote a review May 2019,50,Pune - Hyderabad,Domestic,Economy,Vistara Good Airlines to fly with.,"This was my second time flying with Vistara. Two years ago we flew from Pune to Delhi. At that time I was not aware that Vistara only goes to International Airports. We were walking out at the Delhi airport and I felt something was different because we were walking endlessly for the baggage and exit. Anyway we were April, since my husband and I are both above 80 we had opted for wheelchairs. Our baggage was screened, wheelchairs were there to take us for our boarding passes. The staff at the counter were very polite and courteous, they took in all our baggage, we were under weight, and we were free to go for a security check. The boys were also very kind to us. After the check we were taken to the Gate and made us comfortable. When boarding was announced we were given priority, which I found was very amazing. The cabin crew was also very helpful kind courteous and pleasant. The food served was fresh and sumptuous. We are very happy we flew Vistara. On landing at Hyderabad wheelchairs were available and the ladies taking us were also very good and kind. Our return from Hyderabad to Pune on 22nd we experienced the same good treatment all along. Thank you Vistara for taking so much care of us, senior citizens. I have recommended your Airlines to all my friends and relatives. My agent did not know that Defence gets a discount but anyway next time we shall avail of the facility. Best wishes"

Chad S wrote a review May 2019,10,Mumbai - Bengaluru,Domestic,Premium Economy,Terrible training or systems communication for cancellation,"You are all aware of the Jet Airways grounding its flights, so one of the legs of my international trips from Mumbai to Bengaluru was canceled. So I booked that leg on Air Vistara on April 20th for the date of June 14th. I was charged $429 with the charge reading Tata SIA Airlines... on my credit card. Since Jet Airways held the rights to all my legs on my international trip, my whole trip to India got canceled. So I called Air Vistara on April 30th to cancel the Mumbai to Bengaluru leg.

Since my fare was a Premium Economy Flexi Fare, the person who spoke to me assured me that there would be no cancellation charges and that I would receive my refund to the credit card. I call AGAIN today, May 2nd, and they have absolutely no documentation of that call on April 30th. Somehow my flight has been magically canceled but with no confirmation email for cancellation (I know my email works since I reset my password for my Air Vistara online account yesterday to make sure it works).

The person who spoke to me today told me that it was canceled because they did not receive any funds from my credit card. I see the charge bright and clear today for the $429 for 3 passengers charged to my credit card with a foreign transaction fee of $12 and change as well from April 20th, sitting today on May 2nd.

Now, what I thought would have been an easy cancellation for most airlines for a recent reservation turns out to be a nightmare for me having to spend extra time to dispute the charge with my credit card thanks to Air Vistara's ineptitude. Either, they need their folks to respond with email notifications for every call or have better training for their phone systems to communicate with their database, wherever the problem lies.

Extremely disappointed and mad that I had to go through this!!! Maybe I will cancel directly on their website next time, but who knows if that would work in refunding my credit card."

Overall service levels have been very good .

Which is why I was taken aback due to the insulting behaviour by one of the cabin crew ( name I did not ask) on my recent trip from New Delhi to Hyderabad UK 899 on 27th April, 2019. This happened in Business Class.

This happened while I had just boarded the flight and the rest of the boarding was going on. I had just settled in my seat and was going through my phone . I am not sure what prompted this crew member to come to me and accused me of taking pictures of the crew members. I was shocked and taken aback by the tone and the manner in which she accused me. I offered my phone to her and asked her to check my images gallery. She did not check and went back to her boarding duties.

I have traveled across the world and in multiple airlines ,but never faced this kind of rude behaviour by a crew member. As soon as the boarding was completed , I sought out the cabin crew in charge and complained to her about her staff's rude behaviour. She said that she had already told the staff not to speak in this tone. As the flight took off , the crew member , who had insulted me, came to apologies and said sorry. I told her my issue with the way she spoke to me, which was absolutely not acceptable.

I hope Air Vistara takes note of this incident and takes enough precautions and staff training. I hope this is an odd experience out and does not become a regular feature."

The downside is (alongside other internal Indian flights) is a weight restriction of 15 kilos which is tough when you are on a multi week tour of India. This appears to be strictly managed and does appear to be a money making exercise. Strangely they don’t appear to manage hand luggage so this does make a cabin bag space at a premium."

1) Call center - Vistara may take a little extra time but get yr work done in one go. Air India difficult to connect and they definitely do you several favors by listening to you and you should feel obliged (I'm being sarcastic in case you have not got it).

2) Vistara check in: Awesome experience. I've checked into to Jet and Air India on biz class. AI as usiual does you a favor. Jet was nice but slightly arrogant, Vistara is friendly and you are glad to be there.

3) Food: Vistara serves you a full meal Veg and non Veg. AI only Veg on domestic flights

4) Unlike other European airlines, premium eco seats here are really premium eco and very very comfortable. No one else in India has prem eco seats

The company is great overall, but on my return flight, I got sick with the in-flight meal few moments after the landing. I wrote to the Customer Service, explaining the issue. And let me say that the reply wasn't really up to the standards they're claiming.

All I was provided were copy/pasted e-mails saying that they are really sorry (me too btw, being sick for an entire week isn't really the most appreciable thing in the world to experience), but since no one experienced the same symptoms, well to bad for me. Oh, and I should have advised the crew on board, which is a really enlightened advise to say on a short flight (Less than 2 hours). So to recap, they are really sorry, they hope I will book again with them without actually taking really seriously the issue I was reporting.

So overall it's a decent flight company, until you have a serious issue. Don't count on them to use their common sense to resolve a failure from their side, which is a bit concerning to retain clients."

Having flown with most of the other Indian airlines in the past, Vistara are definitely a cut above the rest (including Air India). We had a good meal, attentive staff, and a punctual, smooth flight. The upgrade to Premium Economy was very good value. We'd definitely use Vistara again, in preference to other airlines in India."

Other airlines have always allowed me to carry additional baggage when connecting to/from international destinations. Ended up paying 3x my original ticket price.. Complete Rip Off
Khushroo wrote a review Apr 2019,40,New Delhi - Mumbai,Domestic,Premium Economy,Classy Domestic Airline,Vistara has been my preferred domestic airline as it is part of Singapore Airlines which is a Star Alliance partner & one of the most elite airlines in the world. Vistara has maintained its standard & the aircrafts are new & the leg space also very comfortable. Inflight food is also very good. It is a very pleasant experience to travel by Vistara.

SM0207 wrote a review Apr 2019,50,New Delhi - Kolkata,Domestic,Economy,Delightful experience,"I travelled on Vistara UK711 del to kol on 7.4.19 and had an wonderful experience . I was carrying a canvas painting which could not be accommodated in cabin baggage due to large size and I was deeply worried that the painting will get damaged if it is checked in luggage . I made the request at the check in counter and handed over my dear painting with lots of apprehension. To my delight , the painting was given a different treatment and it was carried in a separate manner and vistara team ensured the painting is well taken care off . To my surprise even while I was waiting for my painting on the baggage belt, it was brought to me separately without being put on the belt . I m really thankful to all the concerned persons who had taken the extra efforts to ensure the safe arrival of my painting ."
Nancy D wrote a review Apr 2019,50,New Delhi - Varanasi,Domestic,Business Class,Vistara really is a star for Inter-India flights,"While trying to find a flight I could trust to be on time (other Indian airlines to smaller cities in my experience can be notorious with cancellations and long delays) I found Vistara. Given that they are a party owned by Singapore Airlines I gave them a try. Glad I did. I was pleasantly surprised with how modern the plane was, the quality of service (full meal in all classes, even on a 90 minute flight), but most important they were on time/schedule. I flew 2 more Vistara flights after this one (Varanasi to Delhi and Delhi to Bangalore) and the experience was repeated. If you need to travel inter-India this would be a great choice."
Kevin R wrote a review Apr 2019,50,New Delhi - Leh,Domestic,Economy,First class even in economy!,"I flew from Delhi to Leh ( return) with Vistara for the first time last August, 2018. I was not familiar with Vistara prior to these flights and was a tad nervous flying with an airline I did not know. What a wonderful surprise for me!! The aircraft was a new airplane. It even smelled spanking new. :)The flight attendants were welcoming and very professional. Even though it was a short flight, a meal was served which was much appreciated. I would highly recommend this airline! What a welcoming change over the national airline which serves very poor service."

Sunil W wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Ahmedabad - Bengaluru,Domestic,Economy,Better airline in the current lot of airlines in India,"The flight was running late, but no announcement, though Ahmadabad is not a silent airport, neither the display board was showing it as late.
The ground crew i.e. at check in counters, at the boarding gates was not well trained and there was a total confusion and lot of time taken for check in as well as in orderly boarding.
If the staff is well trained, then there is a possibility for Vistara to achieve a greater customer satisfaction."

explorer_too wrote a review Apr 2019,10,Mumbai - New Delhi,Domestic,Business Class,Picky picky late late,"Isn’t this supposed to be a good customer service friendly airline?
I don’t know, maybe the agents did not the memo. Starting with check in to boarding the plane bad experience. For half a kg of excess they made me check in my handbag, mind you this is the same bag I had carried on jet airways on in-going flight. They turned around the late incoming aircraft with no cleaning the aircraft.

To top it all they took an hour to get the baggage onto carousel on arrival. Never again Vistara"
ward27342 wrote a review Apr 2019,50,New Delhi - Pune,Domestic,Economy,Excellent,"I’ve travelled on a few Airlines through India but this new Airline was a class above. Well staffed with very courteous but firm ( no you can’t change seats until all the passengers are boarded , no we are boarding row 19 - 26 please wait until your row is boarding) staff. They seemed to have staffed to the proper level consequently both the outward and return flights left on time. I must admit it was a pleasure to travel with them"

misshotelreviewer wrote a review Apr 2019,40,New Delhi - Ahmedabad,Domestic,Economy,Highly recommend the airlines. One of the best low cost carrier,"Given the number of low cost carriers in the country, Vistara is one of the best. Their service is excellent and the staff is courteous and helpful. They are high in cleanliness and are always on time. The food and beverage offered was fresh and delicious and passengers did not have to pay for the same. The crew was patient, helpful and well trained. Flying Vistara is indeed value for money. Plus, the airplane had a very smooth take off and landing which came as a surprise compared to the way other carriers land and almost throw you out of your seat!"

Nandini wrote a review Mar 2019,50,New Delhi - Kolkata,Domestic,Economy,Pleasure indeed,"Flight was clean and on time. Service prompt. Efficiency was it its best. Meals and beverages served on time. I bought some fkavoured xashews and almonds boxes on flight and they were worth it. Not expensive yet of a high quality.

Suggestions - for small children, it would be nice if a toy or a book is given to them as a gift. Wish the inflight attendants and air hostesses could smile a little. The food as dinner, MUST be better- the sweet was unacceptable and the chicken preparation served with rice was spicy.
Since the idea of flight is not food, i gave a high rating.
For a genuine reason and in the same day of booking if one needs to cancel or modify the booking, it must be allowed free of cost with NO deduction whatsoever."

YourSunshine wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Pune - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Recent Experience - Is the Airline going the way of the others?,"Flying Air Vistara for me has always been a pleasure. But recently I have noticed small changes in customer relations. The last one left me absolutely upset. I was flying at a time when there was enhanced security at the airport post the Balakot surgical strike and terrorist attacks were expected. The airline therefore issued an advisory to flyers to carry the very minimum in hand and made an allowance to club the weight permitted for cabin baggage with check in baggage. Which meant if you are allowed 15 kgs check in, you could add in 7 kgs permitted for cabin baggage and it would be fine to carry 22 kgs check in. From Delhi to Pune, there was no problem. However, from Pune to Delhi, it seems the airline staff at the airport had no clue about the advisory or how the weight was to be managed and for one hour the Customer Service Manager would not accept any explanation. I had in fact double checked with the customer relations helpline before packing if the advisory was still in place and it was ok to check in 22 kgs and the same was confirmed to me. In fact I had only 19 kgs and no hand baggage. But this man insisted on refusing to accept my baggage and I felt really humiliated and insulted in front of all the passengers checking in. I had arrived first at the check in counter and and hour later when almost all passengers were through security, finally the aiport manager made an appearance. I once again retrieved the advisory and made them both read it and speak to the supervisor at the customer service helpline, after which they sheepishly checked in for me and gave me my boarding pass. The CS Manager was not one bit apologetic and still did not think he was wrong. I took up the matter with the Nodal Officer who promised to take action. It is now over two weeks, I still have not heard from them about what action was taken. At the end it seems that Customer Relations is only about saying some sweet words to the customer and getting away."

This review is based on my first experience onboard Vistara. To be honest i had very little expectation from this airline and was also a little excited about it. The very first thing notified my eyes was the smiling crew (ground-staff included). The crew onboard were professional from the origin to the destination. The food was good and cleanliness was maintained. All in all I had a delightful experience. I happily signed up for the frequent flyer program (Club Vistara) and I'm pretty much enjoying the CV privileges. Nowadays, my travel starts with Vistara and ends with Vistara. I truly have ""Flown the new Feeling"" and now it's your turn. I highly recommend flying you Vistara. Happy flying!!"
