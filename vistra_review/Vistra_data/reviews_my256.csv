In most other similar airlines I had traveled before one had to buy one's meals at inflated prices.

The seats were spaced reasonably good and I did not feel cramped as I felt in other airlines. However mind you many - not all economy seats - do not have lean back seats. On a three hour flight a lean back seat affords slightly improved comfort . On this flight my wife and I had seat No. 09A and 09B and both were non reclining seats.

The price factor is also at par with other no-frills airlines flying on the same sectors. So makes sense to opt for Vistara for sure."

Their airhostess very rude( definitely not trained by Singapore Airlines staff). Am a regular traveller via Singapore Airlines and their staff are one of the best. Seat and leg space are quite OK. Food was a big disappointment, just like Jet Airways either option A or B.it was a morning flight around 10 and reaching Bangalore by 12:20 and they were offering a heavy sandwich. Wrote to the airlines via Twitter, his reaction was ""we don't charge extra for food"" and the options are arrived after some data analysis. Definitely not worth of money while traveling by Economy class in Vistara (maybe they want us to travel by Premium economy /business)."

This time i would like to say the management to improve on the meal or the snacks served during the flight. I had the Non veg puff and it was damn Soggy. it seems like it was lying with them for hours and they heated up and served us.This is not the standard of Vistara as i know. Also most of the passengers were asking for the spoon and it was not available with the inflight attendants.
Would like to mention the name of Ms. claire (hope i got the name right)was kind enough to listen to me as she asked whats wrong when i asked for the feedback form. she was kind enough to get me the business class meal,but as i was not feeling like i did not had. also to let you know that there was a old lady sitting besides me and she was alone. the hostess Claire went again and again and kept her asking if she needs anything as the old lady didn't even had a bottle of water during the flight. this is what the hospitality is and i appreciate her gesture.
Do improve on the meal part and rest you are always the best. Again coming to your flight on 24th May to Varanasi. See you soon :)"

Food, beverages and cleanliness was excellent too. Thanks to Kusang, Lhouvino, Chaitali, Sahiba and Burhan.
Unfortunately the last leg of journey was troubling as in my opinion the pilot erred in landing. A major disaster was averted at the last seconds, the wheels were maybe seconds from touching tarmac when it was airborne again abruptly, taken to great height and landed back after 15 minutes. Pilot blamed the winds but it was a case of higher speed and altitude during touchdown. A major mistake in my opinion.
All's well that ends well....Thank you Almighty"

Being a platinum member of Jet Airways frequent flyer programme for almost a decade and having used Jet Airways almost as a default choice for a quarter century ( ever since its inception), I was keen to fly on Vistara for comparative study.
Web check in through mobile app failed but was successful via their website opened on desktop. Lady at check in counter was efficient and helpful, the process was slightly better than usual experience with Jet.The Vistara aircraft appeared slightly more tidier and specious. It was probably due to less than 100% occupancy. Seats appeared a bit more comfortable.
Food quantity and quality was similar. Quality of in flight announcements was similar and uniform and smartness was similar and mediocre.

Even if I want to use miles or vouchers, i am being told that the business is full and when you sot in the aircraft you see seats available in business. They want to just sell. I am not sure why you make platinum members. They give preference to staff than passengers. I had complaint in writing n number of times, i do not get acknowledgement forget about solution.

Economy",Mismanaged traveller information on meals. Rude hostess.,"Everything went perfect till boarding gate. The staff was helpful and adjusted our requirements as we were a large group of 7 people including women and children.

The guy on the boarding gate was rude and irritated when asked that would it be possible to board the plane on priority as we had cranky children with women in our group. Secondly after mentioning child meal plan and getting written and oral confirmation from your airline still there was no child meal.

The hostess didn't even offer us water for 20 mins including the time where service was conducted. Coffee is worthless as creamer based black coffee made into brown coffee is the worst I've had in years.

The person from north east of Indian origin presumably the senior hostess had rudeness written all over her face and actions. Some alter ego she had. Didn't get her name or would have surely mentioned it here.

All in all a below average experience compared to indigo and spicejet.

The only plus was the aeroplane type, design and seating. Also for the same price as an indigo in the same sector it was worth it. The pilots ability to handle the plane was good but sorry to say no ability to have a dialogue with his / her passengers.

I didn't like it.

Thanks a million for keeping me alive mid air."

However when cabin girl came with food cart I just picked up a bottle of water from cart top, which is usual and followed by a smile of cabin girl. To my utter surprise the cabin girl virtually snatched water bottle from my hand and said you can not take like this and then gave me after some time when cart came to my seat.

Premium Economy",Never Fly Vistara Airlines if You Can Help It!,"From beginning to end- this airline was a complete nightmare.

1. Rude, inefficient, could-care-less counter agents
2. Because I was slightly over the 24 hr periods since my international flight, my 30 kg bag cost an addition $185 because of the 15 kg domestic weight limit (try flying with 2 weeks of suits for business for 15 kgs)
3. Having to go to a separate cashier to pay for the excess baggage took an additional 45 minutes to the long check-in; barely making it to the flight;
4. Rude clumsy security guards opened my carry-on spilling two gifts to the floor shattering them- not even an apology;
5. Cattlecall boarding with rude people butting in line and gate agents not caring at all

And to top it off-
6. They LOST my bag on a direct flight with all suits and shirts and toiletries for my work the next day. Baggage claim was horrific and bureaucratic and I still don’t have my checked suitcase (for which I paid extra). No offer to bring my bag to my hotel the next day when it was scheduled to arrive “you’ll have to pick it up at the ticket counter.”
7. After involving US Embassy to get Vistara to bring my bag from Dehli to Bungaluru; the bag arrived at the hotel - it looked as if it had been turned completely upside down and emptied out. Missing were my extra iPhone case, power cables, my waterproof iPhone case. My extra kit for medicines had been gone through and antibiotics taken. The zipper of the suitcase had been pried open and the zipper broken so you couldn't seal the suitcase completely, and one of the four wheels had been destroyed (I had to throw it away). Our belief is that this probably occurred because the suitcase sat overnight in the Delhi airport and Vistara had not locked it away for safe keeping.

NEVER ever again. We took Indigo and Jet Airways for other flights internal to India and had none of these issues. You have several alternative airlines to use for these routes in India. I would recommend using them."

We had a consumed Chivas Regal liquor bottle in our check in baggage, which had around 150 ml of alcohol. At CIAL (Kochi) airport, as per the direction of a Vistara ground staff, when we scanned our check in baggage in the Vistara X-ray counter, he did not allow us to carry the liquor bottle. We told him that it is not in our hand baggage and we have tightly sealed and secured the bottle, so that it won’t spill. We also had perfume in a glass bottle. He did not create any problem regarding that. He only had a problem with the Chivas regal bottle. He asked to put it in the dust bin. We suspect that because it was an expensive liquor, he wanted to take it from us. If he wanted that, he could have asked me for a new bottle and I would be happy to buy him a new one. I told him that I have carried open liquor bottles several times in both domestic as well as international flights and there was no problem at all. Another CIAL staff told him that it is permitted to carry the bottle. But he was so adamant and arrogant and did not allow us to take it. Later when we checked with CISF staff as well as other Vistara staff in Kochi and Delhi, they told that we can carry consumed liquor bottle in our check in baggage in a manner that it won’t spill in our baggage. The Vistara staff at the Kochi airport X-ray counter unnecessarily created a problem for us. We lost so much time because of this and created unnecessary tension in our pleasure trip. Is this the way Vistara treats their customers. This type of rude and arrogant staff should be thrown out of the organization.

Compared to Jet Airways, aircraft seems comparable though the last time I took Jet Airways in 2016 on domestic, the aircraft seems newer for Jet.

Service wise, obviously the staff are trained by SIA/Silk Air team and it feels like you are on Silk Air.

Food wise, portion bigger than Jet Airways if I remember correctly. Taste wise is quite normal for economy.

Being a Krisflyer member (just normal level), my baggage was tagged priority as Premium Economy passenger. The ground staff at Mumbai even stamped priority on my boarding pass and told me I could board with the Premium Economy group. Although this did not help much as most already boarded when I was at the gate.

Interestingly, from Delhi to Bangalore, I did not get above. However, during boarding I saw the economy queue was quite long and I walked over to the priority lane and ask nicely if I could board first as a Krisflyer member and the agent say to go ahead.

We were seated on 1A and 1C. The cabin crew was not at all considerate to an old lady. She was the last one to be asked and served meal. When everyone had finished we were served. I completely fail to understand the reason for this behaviour. It has left such a bad impact on us and I don’t have words how I felt despite spending so much she did not even a basic courtesy to a senior citizen. The crew in general was very very slow and were just busy chatting. I have never experinced anything like this before where the crew was so lazy and completely not bothered. I pressed attendants button atlest thrice and no one turned up. It’s unbelievable how careless the crew can be. I sincerely hope a reputed airline like your will take some serious action and in future no senior citizen will go through the humiliation which my mother did today.

Domestic
Premium Economy",Truly it's a new feeling,"When flying on domestic routes my first preference used to be Jet Airways but when I tried Vistara for the first time on a Delhi-Pune route everything changed and I have been choosing Vistara as my preferred airlines on domestic routes.

Vistara is a Tata-Singapore Airlines joint venture and one can expect both class and competitive pricing. Vistara has an all Airbus 320 fleet and are introducing the 320 Neo and Bengaluru to Delhi is one such route where Vistara flies their new 320 neo aircrafts.

Check-in and Boarding Experience:

The best part is that I had Vistara Silver club membership which came with a complimentary class upgrade so at the check-in counter I got an upgrade from economy to premium economy. Now premium economy has it's advantages like priority luggage tags applied, priority boarding etc.

Vistara flight was on time and got quick access to the plane through priority lane and was greeted by cabin crew.

On Board Experience:

As expected premium economy seats had extra leg rooms, came with a soft pillow as well. The new 320 neo had mood lightning so it truly was refreshing.

Vistara has a menu for premium economy and offers some really good dinner on board. They also serve Starbucks coffee in this class which was good. Food quality and quantity were both appreciable. Good job in that department.

Overall a nice experience on board and we reached before time.

Deboarding Experience:

The best part is that in Delhi Vistara operates from T3 terminal and on this terminal arrival experience is like a cake walk. Due to priority tags the luggage arrived too early that it was taking a second round on the conveyor belt.

Final Thoughts:

Flying Vistara was truly a new feeling and I am waiting for Vistara to start its international operations soon. Also, I have seen that it seems to be the only airlines which provides special assistance to female travellers in terms of allocating good seats and helping with the baggage pick-up to arranging a taxi."

However, the flight timing changed twice but the ground staffs were also clueless for the departure which I found little weird and hence I given them 4 stars instead 5. But during our return journey the ground staffs in Delhi were extremely helpful and offered me help as I was traveling alone with a kid.

The arrival time in Kolkata enables one to freshen up and then start with the business of the day in the city. The leg space in the economy class was more than what one finds in most carriers. The refreshments served was not stale, something we have got used to having mid-air. However the bland coffee spoiled the good taste of the croissant a bit, and could have been better. There was some mid-air turbulence, but the pilots managed it all right. The one thing that definitely needs to improve is the landing at Kolkata which was anything but smooth."

We were travelling as Premium Economy passengers so we had extra legroom and the seats were comfortable. The cabin crew were very polite and efficient.

Once seated were were given a drink of water and a menu detailing the food and soft drinks available (no alcoholic drinks) also a wet hand/face towel.

About 20 minutes into the flight we were offered a drink of either a Cola or orange juice. Roughly 30 minutes later we were served lunch, there were 3 options available, we chose the Oriental vegetable dish. A chicken curry dish or a veg biryani were also on offer. There was nothing wrong with our meal, however it was not to our taste, everything else was fine.

Once lunch was over we were offered tea or coffee. We were certainly kept well hydrated

We airborne at 12.35 and it was announced that it would be a 2 hour flight, however did not land in Delhi till 15.00 which was the scheduled landing time

Business Class",Very good service.,"The reason why I like Vistara airlines is their luggage allowance for domestic flights. If you are traveling in business class and have an international flight, vistara Airlines allows you to exceed your baggage allowance as long as you show them an international flight the same day or the next day. This is one of the main reasons why I choose to take the starter Airlines another reason is the fact that they fly an Airbus A320 which is a lot more comfortable than one of those ATR aircraft"

The packet of food is also very awesome. I had never seen such a good packaging for food. The tag line on the food box is “what is inside the box is out of the box”. Really the food is out of the box.

After dealing with a chaotic check-in process in GOA, we got on a completely full flight. Service was similarly chaotic with carts repeatedly going up and down the isle multiple times for no apparent reason. Special meals were handed out in random order - some before the main meal was served - some after the main meal was served. Sleeping passengers were woken up to ask about their meal options - which seemed crazy. If people are sleeping - let them sleep. When all calmed down - I peacefully continued reading my book on the iPad. All was well until landing when Philo. the flight attendant, decided I needed to completely power off my iPad. This is the rule she said. Well it wasn't the rule on Vistara three days ago when I headed to Goa. Completely annoying."

""Lunch"" seemed marginally better as a bun was provided. The dessert was not worth eating. I remember airline food being better than this, at least Jet airways used to. Traveled with kids but no one seemed to care, air hostesses seemed too hassled and busy handling the serving, and made faces even if you needed to go to the washroom with a kid.

After good old Air Sahara, I think there's is the only airline currently in India ,with pleasant cabin crew members. Their checkin staff at counters is also good and provides you all help needed. I have never ever had any problem with the airline's staff other than this one incident that happened on my way back to Delhi from Amritsar.
Checkin was smooth and it was only while boarding that all chaos happened. So basically when boarding was announced, there were 2 lines made by the crowd and it was difficult to see the priority boarding board as there were a lot of people ahead of us in groups. We were total 8 of us,including 2 kids and 4 senior citizens. So our parents were ahead of us and were sent thru the same line in which we had lots of other passengers also. I was stopped rudely by the ground staff Puneet Sharma(who told his name also so rudely when asked), and was told that I was in wrong line as this was priority boarding line. He shouted at the top of his voice for this and honestly I don't think that was needed. I was traveling with a 2 year old in my lap and a 10 year old, so even if the airline does not gives priority to families with kids(I was told this by the same guy and confirmed by the duty manager that vistara has policy not to give priority to families with young kids), still all this guy could have done, was to be polite. People are returning after a small holiday and he is just at the right place to ruin it. Extremely rude and arrogant guy. Duty manager should realize that sending the flight off at right time is not the only responsibility but he also has to make sure that same people travel again with their airline by training his staff well. If people don't buy tickets,unfortunately you guys also will stop getting paid. Taking sides for rudeness is absolutely not acceptable. Thumbs down for these 2 people from otherwise marvelous staff of Air Vistara."

Arriving very early for the flight as one of the first to check-in we were told that we could get Business for the price off premium economy. Shown the picture of the fancy seats and all we thought, 'Why not lets treat ourselves' Thats £20 not £100's, no brainer

We were told to wait next the counter until they allocated our seats. However, after the airport police, immigration and even members of Vistara had hassled us about our nearly missing the flight, myself going to teh desk three times and being told to wait 2 more minutes, we got our boarding pass.

We were then pushed through the airport like we had arrived super late. Marched on to the plane past the business class seats into premium economy... which is rubbish. Its economy seating with a food option.

Furthermore we had aisle seats two seats away from any view.

Having been hassled I quickly made a point of telling someone there had been a mistake. I was told to sit down and the head of the ground crew came to talk to me. I expressed my concern that we had been pushed around and given the wrong seats. He told me he would be back and left the plane. Before you know it we were rolling on to the runway.

I was so annoyed to have payed more to get less and be treated poorly that I talked to the head of crew cabin.... who were helpful and professional.

I was told that it had been logged and that I could enjoy the free food. My details taken and that i could have a refund of sorts.

After teh flight I emailed Vistara and they took a month to get back, told me that it was very bad what had happened but nothing of a refund. At this point I should say that the refund is only small but it was the principle of the thing. I was still annoyed at the treatment by the staff on the ground. Being lied to about the upgrade, made to wait, pushed around and then not listed to and left on the plane.

I kept on asking about teh refund and did not get a clear answer. They used peripheral wording to drag my attention from the matter.

This is the most expensive option you can have. I would use spice jet ever bit of the way. For a domestic flight they are cheap, efficient and run to and from nearly everywhere. You can upgrade for a fiver for extra leg room with window seats and they give you some snacks as well.

Vistara, would rather hold on to a little money in anyway they can instead of except their own blame. I was told that we had used teh service, but I had been told to except it by way of a sorry on the plane."

It brings all the right elements from SIA, one of the leading airlines companies in the world and the indian business expertise from one of the biggest companies in India. Everything starting from the booking process to seat selection, which is free by the way, and goes a long way in providing customer satisfaction, to on time departures and efficient boarding process and most importantly, lavish seating and leg space. They are also probably the only airlines in the domestic indian circuit which serves meals on board free of charge and they have a wide variety to choose from like vegan, religious and the likes. The baggage collection doesn’t make you wait either and here is a little secret, even if your bags are a little over the capacity, they are very accommodating if you are in their frequent flyer program and that too even without asking. In short, this was by far the best domestic travel experience I had in India. Flights may be a bit on the expensive side and the airline is pretty new and as result is absent from most of the sectors in the domestic route but I hope they expand their reaches soon. In short I will close my eyes and fly with them again and I don’t mind shelling the extra buck for their service."
