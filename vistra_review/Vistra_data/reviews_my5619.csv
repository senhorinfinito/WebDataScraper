You can see the influence of Singapore Airlines in this joint venture with TATA - cabin crew are very friendly, efficient and smart, and the crews' uniforms are practical.

Plenty of leg room and the seat was comfortable. A cooked meal was included. I had non veg and I thought the chicken curry was very good, but it may be a bit too spicy for some individuals.

Thoroughly recommend and I'm looking forward to my Chandigarh flight with Vistara in November."

Premium Economy",A breath of fresh air!,"An average Indian domestic route traveler isn't spoilt for choices, rather accustomed to selecting least bad from the worst.

While we all know, Tata pioneered the air travel in India, later to be nationalised by the then Government just to abuse the premium travel sector in the name of Air India, and today, the legacy Tata air had set is wiped off by more lathargic than ever, Air India. But it's not just the national carrier to be blamed par se, the full carrier premium airlines like Jet airways compete in incompetence overall too.

Having said all this, and starved of choices, the shiny new Vistara is quite a respite. It brings in the Tata value that we are all pampered with, you will know what I mean if you're a Taj Hotels baby.

Vistara not only has the newest boings and airbus, it's cleaner and visually appealing interiors (cooled enough) are extremely welcoming.

Staff, both, on ground and in the air take good care of you no matter how cranky you are about anything.

Needless to say food served by Taj catering is fresh, warm and homely.

Net net, worth taking a flight when traveling in India!"

Vistara was a new player in teh LCC segment and I decided to give it a try considering the Singapore Airline( Prekium Airline, which has collaboration with many airlines like Silk Airways) and Tata.

The flight experience was quite good. 4 Ratings for a LCCs price range flight. Delicious meal( though very limited) was served during flight( as it was inclusive in the cost). The best part of the journey was all the seats had much larger leg space compared to Spice and Indigo. I am a 6' 1'' feet guy and I always find it difficult to sit in the Spice/Jet/Indigo.

They cancelled two flights for which we had business class tickets described on them as ""Confirmed and Guaranteed"". After we had booked they cancelled both flights and failed to tell us. It was only by complete chance that I noticed the day before we were to leave England that these flights were not on their schedule checker any more.

I rang their call centre in India and was told that both flights had been cancelled. I asked how they had informed us and they said by text. When I said no such text had been received despite them having the correct number on the booking he suggested it might be because it was a UK mobile phone number. No email confirmation of cancellation had been received despite them having correct email address.

Despite having cancelled both flights they had kept the money I had paid them.

I obviously asked for the full refund and they said that it would take ten days before this could be enacted because it was an international credit card. Interestingly there was no such delay when paying for the tickets.

Astoundingly bad service which could have completely ruined my trip if I had not noticed problem by chance."

As i requested for Aisle seat i was given the same immediately. Staff are friendly. Ofcourse better than go air and Indigo.

I wanted to rate them excellent but due to two reason i can't.

1. During boarding process even though i had silver membership and there was separate queue, i was asked to wait by the ground staff. As i was not in hurry i waited for few min and then again asked showing my boarding pass again. Got a reply that ""I haven't seen you, or you might have shown the boarding pass to other"" though i was standing next to him for few minutes.
See in service industry first impression is last impression.

2. The second spoiler was dinner. I already had disgusting experience in premier plaza lounge. When food was served i asked for veg. It was not up the mark. I just had to satisfy myself with curd.

At DEL airport, I could not find any pointers/boards regarding the check-in counter opening time. The Check-in had Air-India uniforms probably this was outsourced to Air-India. How can a airline outsource a people dependent job to Air-India staff.

The process at gate was smooth. Seeing the Air-hostesses one gets the feeling that they are freshers and this is their first airline cabin job. The person who was making the announcement spoke Hindi with an heavy English Accent. The hindi announcement on Swiss Airlines flight was more genuine that Vistara's.

I was not expecting a hot meal on a domestic private airline and we got a hot meal. The staff was helpful and friendly, the aircraft were clean and new, the seats were comfortable and there was good legroom.

The only thing I found irritating is having to go through security, opening hand luggage again before boarding the aircraft when you have already gone through the long lines at check in and the long and slow security at the airport. Maybe the date of travel being 14 August, day before Independence day may have been a factor in the additional check."

Secondly, the flight was delayed by an hour and neither he informed nor the boarding gate informed me of the same. Made to sit there for a long time and unsure whether I had time for a quick meal, we boarded and the flight served insufficient quantity of food though it is my understanding that most full service airlines serve lunch if they are airborne between 12.00 pm and 2.00 pm. All they served was a snack. Also they had no system for a passenger to pay for and upgrade himself either at Chandigarh or at the Gate at New Delhi.

Booking was done through a travel aggregator portal. On-line check-in was seamless. if you are an iPhone user, you get a boarding pass option for the wallet on your phone (I don't know if any other Indian airline company has this option. It is so convenient and cost effective and saves paper)

Airport reps were of pleasing personality and efficient. baggage drop was quick. planing process was systematic and once in the plane, the crew were welcoming and helpful. Captain's welcome was warm with flight weather and ETA communicated to all flyers.

Food was a sandwich, cookie, mango beverage - decent at best. cannot complain. crew was quick to disburse snacks and clearance as well.

Seat was comfortable. legroom was just right (i'm 6 feet tall). The magazine content was mediocre say when compared to Jet wings of Jet airways. I would like to see better content.

Overall, an excellent FULL-SERVICE airline. will definitely fly again."

But I was shocked to note the level of service before the flight.

First, my flight from Bombay to Goa was cancelled and they informed me only 2 days prior to ETD. The shocking bit was I had to make several calls to their customer service to convince them to put us on another airline on the same departure date, given that I had back to back hotel and flight bookings.

On my return from Goa, when we reached the airport, I was once again shocked to note that they had suspended our ticket! The reason being that the ticket was booked on an international credit card. We had to wait till their Delhi office could unblock the tickets after verifying my credit card!

That was not the end of our plight! The flight was delayed by an hour!

I have given Vistara 2 stars as the flying and in flight experience was great. Their level of pre flight services is horrible.

I will try never to fly Vistara again and would not recommend this airline to anyone. If you still want to fly Vistara, do so at your own risk.

I think that whilst this is a nice carrier, it still has a way to go to settle into its niche. For considerably less, Indigo offers almost the same level of experience for the average traveller, on similar aircraft. Would I fly them again? Yes, although I would also look to other carriers as well."

This Airline scores well in every department. Since I had web[-checked in it took less than a minute to enter the revised gate number. The boarding process was quick as I preferred to board last.

After a warm welcome by the crew and settling down the push back was delayed due to the use of the Secondary Runway but the Captain kept the guests fully informed.

The take-off was smooth but there was a bit of turbulence. The food service began once the cruise was normal. I got a good feeling after the meal that this airline does care for the guests but offering the right quantity of food.

The landing was smooth and the plane docked at the aero-bridge quickly.

Upon reaching the terminal I requested for the buggy and the staff called one fast.

Domestic

The security at the airport gate refused me entry saying my web-checkin pass did not carry my name! Well, after a visit to the counter I finally got in. I had to wait for over 10 minutes just for a baggage drop. The boarding took even longer with an additional elaborate security check by the airlines staff at the aircraft door.
I had taken care to book a seat in the economy first row. But i was in for a shock. Instead of having wider leg room, this row is more cramped as the premier class (something between business and economy) takes away extra space.
The announcements were with a strong accent making it largely incomprehensible. The refreshments were oh-so-familiar: dal and rice, dahi and a dessert. Since my journey had two sectors, the refreshment in the second sector had the same dessert, a lemon mousse/custard.
The only saving grace was that the flight was on time which means a lot. But it is also a little worrisome to note how much the airlines reminded one of the erstwhile Indian Airlines, the food, the announcements, even the interior decor. Finally, the stewardesses' attire could have been better designed: it resembles a pajama suit!
I booked on it only because it had the cheapest ticket going, but next time i have to think twice.
Being a new airline I would give them the benefit and expect them to improve over time."

Since it is a fairly new airline with a brand new fleet of aircraft, the interiors were impeccably spic & span. Was warmly greeted by very well groomed cabin crew, I love the uniforms too, practical to work in and elegant at the same time. The business class cabin I flew in was spacious, I love the overall purple & dull gold colour scheme of the seats and not using cloth as the upholstery instantly ups the luxury of the cabin interior. We had a decent selection of meals & drinks presented on printed menu cards. Although the food tasted average, the warm service provided by the Cabin Crew was really a pleasure. They interacted with me on a personal level, I felt like a guest, not just another pax. Lavs were spotless as well. The galley was kept neat all through the flight.

It seemed that I was flying on the old Air India attitude Airline....with the cabin crew as if they were on a protest and were forced to service the passengers. The Air hostessess all of them never had even half a smile and seemed stressed out and got the feeling of being least bothered to the passengers. After this experience I who have been flying now extensively for over 38 years have not flown this carrier and do not intend to in the near future as well.

Food is same for both except for an additional fruit drink in PE and wet towel .

However, once inside the plane, it was good. Obviously, with new aircrafts it will be better.

The food was also very good. Both in term of variety & taste.

We were travelled from ahmedabad to mumbai in another Airline. That day there were heavy raining in mumbai so due to traffic condition in mumbai airport our flight landed 30 mins delay. And we were rush to departure for check in at vistara airlines departure point. As we have reach at last minute the attendant was about to print our boarding pass one of the manager comes and told boarding has been close. We were know that due to heavy rain our mumbai cochin vistara flight will also get delay. So we argue with the manager a lot finally after 15 minutes of argument he told that he will allow only passengers not our luggage. And finally we have to decide that 2 of the people will left over with all of the luggage at mumbai only. And rest of us rush to the flight. Later we come to know that flight was already 1hour delay. So once we reach to the aircraft we told our colleges that flight will depart 1 hour later why he should allow our luggage and all of us. So they go to the manager and fight with words but he still didn't allow them to board. Very rude and unfriendly behaviour of the airline staff. Will never travel and recommend vistara airline.

On board. Clean. New. Smiles by all the crew. Food, super. And if it weren't for Bombay's overcrowded airspace that delays every flight, the journey would be flawless. Vistara helps in taking away a lot of those irritants!"

Yes, they do not offer porch side pick up, etc but vistara get its basic right. Ive flown in all their 3 classes - economy, premium economy and business at different times and the service was impeccable in all 3 classes. Quick efficient staff, smooth check in process, minimal waiting time in economy queue, a good lounge at Gate 41 and the airline seats, from economy to business are the best in domestic sectors. refreshing change is their food. Reminds me of the quality of the old jet airways in flight food. Cant wait for them to start flying international and increase their domestic connectivity."

3. The food and beverages served again made a difference but the Dessert served by them during this flight was extremely non-eatable (Dry Sweet Seviyan)

Vistara will surely carve a niche for itself with the kind of customer experience they are offering. They have an amazing lounge at the T3 airport. Boarding and checkin was smooth. One thing that really stands out is the legroom in Economy Class! Not much in-flight entertainment options though. Just a magazine, when they could have video screens with full entertainment system easily. Food was limited to cookies and an appy fizz since it was a short haul flight to Chandigarh. But I will give them prompt and friendly service and flight smooth and on time. Overall enjoyed flying with them and would consider again for flying."

more for premium economy because they would give you a wet towel and juice and a coke if you wanted to buy.Coming to the buisness class as I told you seats were same just a bit more cushioning . The service was same.The Seats just reclined more .It was the buisness class the worst I had ever seen .The kids on the plane shreiking and shouting. There was a 5yr old boy who was crying because he had a wet diaper the parents did not bother to take him to the restroom.They infact changed the diaper there.The whole flight was stinking of poo and pee .My mom infact felt like puking.
The food was very bad if you took the veg or non veg the matatar paneer was stale the bread was bad the sevayin were also bad the chicken and rice were also stale. the service was average for buisness bad for premium economy and terrible for economy.I even tried to ask for water I pressed the button and no one replied .

I am Anish Garg. My Pnr was 6NIJU8.I travelled to Mumbai from New Delhi in flight UK943 departed from New Delhi at 07:35 am on 25 May 2016.
This was my 3rd experience with Vistara.
But this time the experience was pathetic. I was happy to get upgraded to premium economy class at the time of check in. But onboard the things are quite different. In 2 hour flight i got the meal 80 minutes after take off. And the crew expect me to have that meal in 10 minutes so that they can clear on time. And they started clearing when the aircraft is preparing for landing and changing directions. All the food basket and trays are falling and they are unable to control.
I was shocked to see that. I didn't expected this type of hospitality from Vistara. The crew members should be trained enough.
I will have to rethink about traveling with Vistara again. Very disappointed.

Aircraft is very Spacious and equipped with good facilities and has simple yet elegant interiors. seats were very comfortable, even for kids. Pilots and crew members were much professional. they knew their role perfectly, and living upto the expectations. be it safety instruction / warning, serving meals, providing any help to kids or adults, older people. Pilots were very proficient that while our journey from delhi to Srinagar, climate wasnt good due to thunderstorm and flight was lil shaky, and we all were very nervous and scared to death. but the way they handled the situation and made our journey worth and safe by taking care of it very nicely. Eventually our trust grew for the airline and their staff. Food was very yummy and upto the mark, (Veg and Non Veg both) we have also requested for child meal which was also good and as per the child's requirement, only my concern was for my baby who is 2 year old, for him i wanted food items like Idli, French fries or Medu wada so that kids of the similar age group kids can have it happily, since they served Pizza and Chole which my baby didn't eat, as he is not used to of eating such food like other kids and ended up having black forest pastry, which he loved the most. but overall our journey was very pleasant and satisfying with Vistara.

Domestic
Economy",A review of flying the new feeling,"I had originally booked myself on an evening flight on another airline but decided to take a morning #AirVistara flight instead. I took the decision one day prior to departure and found that the #AirVistara economy class pricing to be much lower than competition – about 15% lower approx. I made my booking on #Cleartrip of course – there is just no other site that is as well designed and intuitive. I put in my FF number on #Cleartrip while booking – usually the airline systems pick this up. The #AirVistara systems didn’t seem to, though.

Web-check in – I had to go to the #AirVistara site to do a seat assignment and check-in. The #AirVistara web-site is really slow and not built keeping the slowness of Indian internet in mind. Too many clunky images that take far too long to download. Once I was inside the web-checkin flow I felt that the flow was not intuitive. I had to first update the FF number – which is a separate funnel from the seat and meal selection. The seat selection is also not intuitive – there is a small box that logically looks like the place to click, but it is not. I was web checking-in about 14 hours prior and noticed that there were hardly any seats that were available – I counted less than a dozen. Is that because the airline system auto-allocates? I know from experience that so many people could not have checked in by themselves so much in advance. The exit row is not available for selection. This, for me, is a big negative as that is the seat that I select all the time and have no qualms about paying the extra charge for that comfort. After I finished checking-in I saw multiple options for delivery of the boarding pass (including an Apple Passbook feature) which I felt was well thought through. I couldn’t print the boarding pass as I didn’t have access to a printer and thought that I would do that at the airport kiosk.

Airport check-in – At the airport, I couldn’t see #AirVistara enabled in the kiosk. A big miss in my opinion, esp. if the core target audience is corporate & business travellers who have probably forgotten what it is like to stand in a check-in queue. At the check-in counter, I checked if the 11F that I had been allotted (thanks to someone in the #AirVistara team allotting this when we called them) was an exit row – and the agent was a bit confused, probably because of the LOPA changes currently underway (the airline is changing to a different seat configuration across their fleet). The service was, however, polite and courteous – definitely a few notches better that my recent experiences with other airlines.

Before the flight – The boarding process was smooth. Not sure if it was because there was no queue and I could walk straight through. The aircraft had a nice clean and fresh look to it and the welcome was warm and friendly. The exit row instructions were delivered personally rather than like a classroom that some airlines do these days. It was delivered well except that the attendant didn’t really make eye-contact all the time – doesn’t leave the right impression if the delivery is to be personal. Asked for some water before we took off and didn’t get it – maybe I was too close to push-back. Even if it was, would have been good to hear from the attendant that I would get it once we take off. I have never been a big fan of leather seats – feel that the leather makes the seat feel very hard, which is how the seats felt to me on the #AirVistara aircraft. The seats needed to be pushed very hard to get them to recline – not sure if that is the way they are designed or if it needs some looking into.

In the air – We pushed back ahead of time and were taxiing on the runway at the STD. That is something that one expects of a base departure anyways. There were only 7 exit row seats occupied which meant that I would have no one in the seat next to me – on a 2:30 long flight that was a luxury. This was in line with the occupancy in the Economy Cabin (I counted about 75 people) – which for a prime-time, week-day, inter-metro flight is a big commercial red flag. With extremely competitive pricing, why was it that #AirVistara was not able to fill the economy cabin? Is there a brand / marketing issue? Did they bank too much on last-minute demand that they forgot to get their share of the advance-booking travellers? Can’t really be an awareness issue as they have now been around for more than 15 months.

Food service – Carts were promptly rolled out as soon as we were airborne and I was served a veg breakfast as requested. My first impression was “Oh my god, the packaging is way too excessive”. Well designed for sure, but there must be other ways of delivering this that is far more ecologically responsible. The cutlery says “oxo-biodegradable pouch & cutlery – contributing to a sustainable planet’. Come on, we are just fooling ourselves if we seriously believe this. The poha and rava kesari/sheera for breakfast was really nice. A welcome change from the unexciting airline food that I have been having every week for the last several years.

The rest of the flight was quite uneventful as I decided to catch up on some sleep after I wrote this blog post. The landing was on time and quite smooth. There was an airport snafu when we got off the plane though – the gates to the terminal was shut and we had to wait for a few minutes before someone could open then.

Will I fly them again? I reckon so if their schedule is convenient for me – for which they will need to add more frequency on the routes that I usually fly every week."

I missed my important meeting and had to reschedule everything. The supervisor Nikhil was too casual and seemed least bothered till I started video taping him. I asked him to provide for his manager's number which he denied saying can't provide and asked me to check the details online. This was my first time that I was trying a different flight than Indigo. Will never ever book Vistara. Just because you have Tata's name don't fleece customers. Over booking is your issue not mine. The same chap told me that you also work for hotels and overbook. Hello man you handle your own stuff rather than pointing fingers to others. I have recording and will press for a court case soon against you guys. Don't take people for granted

At Goa airport Vistara staff however are in a league of their own.
They really know what is customer service. They simply meet and exceed expectations each and every time. I would name everyone of them as doing a superb job each and every time I fly back to Bombay.
I use Goa and Delhi as my main sectors, and there is no question of using any other airline.
I only hope they increase more flights to more destinations out of Bombay.

The ticket was booked by my wife and as this happened to be the only flight meeting my time requirements-It was going to be Vistara (a tie up of TATA and Singapore Airlines). I was expecting an uneventful flight and it was. The check-in staff were well spoken and well dressed as is the case with all airlines. (I might have generalized a bit about all airlines having well spoken staff.) Boarding was also carried out in sequential order of seating of course giving priority to women, children and elderly. Again now a days most airlines conduct their boarding in this manner so nothing new here. One thing which caught my attention was that in their announcements they referred to us (passengers) as ""customers"" which felt sort of depersonalized and distant. As I boarded the flight, it was obvious that they had acquired new planes-it felt clean and fresh. Found my seat and buckled up. After take off, they started the refreshment service. The food was good both in terms of quality and quantity. A lot of the passengers were fasting for navratra so they refused the food. The stewardesses could have cared less-they offered, the passengers refused-end of story. But this was not the case here. They kept asking them with a sound of genuine concern if they would like something else or if they would like to take something to eat later. This is what touched me most about this flight. Singapore airlines is known for their excellent service and hospitality and the staff at Vistara is doing a good job of upholding that tradition and this is why i believe it is one of the best domestic airlines I have flown till date. Their prices tend to be a bit on the pricier side and it would be nice if something could be done to make them more competetive so everyone would be able to get the Vistara experience and not just go for the other airline only because of the cheap air fare.
Its been more than a year since I have flown Vistara but my wife happened to travel with them recently and she assures me that they have maintained their hospitality even now."

I hadn't heard of it before but soon found out that two big names, Tata and Singapore Airlines have come together to form Vistara. The word 'Vistaar' in Sanskrit means 'expanse'. Apt for an airline.
Vistara? A friendly face asks and guides me in Delhi airport even though I didn't need it. Inside, I think...hmm, that's nice! I asked for a window seat and got one. Early bird, I know but with the times I have had to travel sitting in the middle seat!! This was bliss! As soon my luggage is checked in I am guided towards the gate. Midway, another friendly face. Vistara? I'm liking this!
Once inside the aircraft, the difference is obvious. Friendly smiling stewards. Not the plastic smiles that do not reach the eyes with the perfunctory reluctant greeting before you reach your seat. Everyone is courteous. A welcome drink of coconut water arrives soon after we are seated. And after that wet towels were distributed. This airline cares!
Mine was a 2-hour-ten-minute flight. Midway between the flight meals were served.I'm including a picture of my non-vegetarian meal of 'Kheema pav"" along with one savoury accompaniment and dessert. It was good! I asked the lady who was seated next to me how hers went and she said she liked it. She had opted for a vegetarian meal. The air steward was very attentive and it was over all a very good experience flying this airline. I'd surely opt for Vistara the next time I travel.
As we reached Guwahati, I left the aircraft feeling that this is the best airline in India!"

The use of violet as a colour make you feel royal. the uniforms of the air hostesses are very well designed and suit and Indian context. The F&B menu boasts of dishes from around the country and items that I have generally not seen in other airlines or many restaurants.

The use of technology - preloaded Tablets with AV content and live streaming of AV over a local wifi loop (in testing phase) is also something that is a first in the Indian Airline scenario.

Seamless check in, helpful staff offered me extra leg room (which i declined as wanted to see what standard leg room in premium economy is like). Boarded on time, all staff from ground to crew all immaculate and professional. Immaculate aircraft, spotlessly clean, nicely cooled, being in premium economy, extra few inches of legroom made all the difference. Cold towel and juice offered before take off, hot meal service during flight. Flight on time and the pilot greased the landing!! Faultless from start to finish.

Separate check-in counters and queues for even premium economy; slightly better airline food served more artfully (though food quantity was small); more leg room and spacious seats (I must admit I am small-framed but the difference is noticeable, nevertheless); gracious staff; on time departure and arrival; the unusual colour of the uniform- royal purple adds to the overall impression of being distinct and different.

There is nothing 'demeaning' about this airline. Good food (much better than others), good service, hospitable and good looking staff. Overall preferred over most other airline!"

Domestic
Economy",Good flights with average service,"We were a group of friends travelling from Mumbai to Bagdogra in the first week of March 2016. Vistara do not operate a direct flight from Mumbai to Bagdogra, we were booked Mumbai to New Delhi UK970 and then New Delhi to Bagdogra via Gauwahati UK765.

The best part about the check in with Vistara is that you get to see the Mumbai T2 Terminal. The overall check in procedure with Vistara is poor. We were asked to move from one counter to another for check in. May be this was due to we being a large group, but we have never faced any such situation before with any other airline operator.

The boarding procedure went on smoothly from Mumbai. However, the arrival gate at New Delhi and Departure Gate were really far from each other. This caused a great inconvenience to the group.

All the seats were booked with seats allotted togather at the time of booking. However, different seat allotted at the check in counter while issuing boarding passes causing the group to sit differently in flight from New Delhi to Bagdogra. We found it surprising that Mumbai New Delhi flight had proper seats allotted to us (same as booking) while New Delhi - Bagdogra had this issue. The cabin crew could not do much as the seat were allotted to other passengers.

The food served in flight was warm and good to eat. Even Jain food that was pre booked for 2 of our passengers was warm and good. The cabin crew was cheerful and helpful.

The landing and take off at all destinations were comfortable.

Overall, we found the experience average and value for money. We would not recommend this airline for Mumbai to Bagdogra, as it takes too long a time."

The flight took off 15 minutes late due to VIP movement (it was on the day of 'Make in India' week in Mumbai and a lot of VIPs were coming in for the inaugural function). However, the Captain made up the time and we landed on time. The only facility that is not present id the ability to choose your own seat on the website at web check-in.
I would certainly prefer Vistara anytime over other airlines."

Right from the quality of service to the menu, everything is aimed at delighting the customer. While everyone has been taking about Jet-Indigo-Spicejet, this airline has quietly made its foray and went onto provide A class service to its guests without much ado.

Special word for Ms. Aanchal, who was very helpful. The airline staff ran with us carrying our cabin luggage, right upto Gate 52 (IGI T3) and ensured that we managed to board the flight. The interiors of the aircraft were clean, seats looked royal, stewards were courteous, and food was good too. We were pleasantly surprised when we collected our luggage at Lucknow as it was marked fragile and eventually loaded in the aircraft at Delhi. Absolutely loved the experience of flying Vistara, and also the airline which gives so much attention to their guests. Thank you Vistara!"

Though my 6 am flight was delayed for almost 6 hrs due to fog departing at 12 but the efficient management and skilled staff never let me feel the crunch. They were well Informed and updated us regularly along with timely meals at 6:30 at the food court then on board at 9 then in the air with some snacks.

Cabin has a fresh interior with all leather seats, adjustable Headrests, enough legroom even in the last row with reclining seats.

The pilot covered the distance in a short time and landed smooth, a very rare experience from a domestic flyer in India.

It has been an amazing experience flying with them since the air staff makes sure you have a comfortable journey and provide you with hot towels during the landing and take off which ensures that you look fresh by the time you get off the flight.

The food, especially, was very good in quality and in line with what one would expect from airlines when flying in the 1980s-1990s. The general aura of the plane and the smartly dressed air hostesses can only be described as trendy. Leg room was adequate, seats were comfortable, air hostesses and staff were courteous, price was right for the service offered. There was no in-flight entertainment probably due to the short flight time (<1 hour)."
