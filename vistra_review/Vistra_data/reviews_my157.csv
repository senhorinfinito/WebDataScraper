XTIAN wrote a review Nov 2018,40,New Delhi - Hyderabad,Domestic,Premium Economy,First experience with Vistara,"Never flew Vistara before, being a Jet privilege member. Recently an opportunity presented itself viz flight schedule, hence I decided to fly with them.

Despite being in premium economy check in counter, it took forever to check in. I thought I made a mistake having booked with them. Ironically the boarding pass printing machine had died.

Having got past that hurdle, I wasn't expecting much. It's best to expect the least with that kind of experience.

However, on time departure and arrival coupled with exemplary in flight hospitality and service helped me get past the debacle at the check in counter. Over all a good experience and value for money."

We bough the premium economy ticket as the customer care agent told us we can take 25kg of check in and 10 kg of hand luggage but when we got to airpot we were told other wise. we could take 20kg instead of 25. Everything just seemed like a big money scheme. Vistara airport customer service and ticketing agents at bagdogra airport were not helpful rather they would just chit chat with each other. IMPORTANT LESSON!!! Always record conversation with vistara people they can flip at anytime. I have never been a reviewer but this experience has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I had to vent it. After a long hassle at the ixb the manger Vinod Tamang helped us but after have been gone through the excruciating process in that heat it meant little. Also the Air hostess from del to ixb were not pleasant. Only good thing about our travel was cup of coffee (starbucks).

Prabir G wrote a review Nov 2018,40,New Delhi - Kolkata,Domestic,Economy,Extremely Professional Service,"I am travelling this morning, 6th Nov 2018, from  Delhi to Kolkata on Vistara flight  UK 747. The scheduled departure  was at 7.45 am  from IGI T3 and we reached airport at 6.15 am. Following is my overall experience about the flight ( Rating given out of 5, 5 being the highest):-
A. Check-in: Checking st Counter C was slightly chaotic due to only three counters open for too nany passengers (Rating 3).
B. Lounge access: I was flying economy and hence there was no lounge faculty offered. I used my Mastercard to access airport lounge(Rating Neutral)
C. Boarding and departure: Boarding opened at 7.10 am at Gate 55 through aerobridge. Boarding process was smooth and fast. The departure was on time. (Rating 4).
D. Seats and interior: The aircraft was an Airbus A320-Neo series and new. The interior in Vistara signature Grey and Purple faux leather upholstered seats and beige wall looked bright and well lit. My selected seat was 15D, an aisle seat at the middle. Seat pitch was reasonable with slightly cramped legspace. Seat recline was about 115 degree.(Rating 3.75).
E. In flight Service: The in-house magazine Vistara provids good informative reading. Hot breakfast was served. Bread roll, butter, masala omelette, parsley potato, grilled tomato, mango dahi and coffee or tea. Quantity, quality and presentation was great much better than all other full service airline in India. Snacks can also be bought from on board CAFE AUBERGINE, if you so wish. (Rating 4.5).
F. Arrival and baggage: Flight landed at Kolkata at 9.40 am  Gates were opened at 9.45 am. My luggage came very quickly on the belt. (Rating 4)

From the Effortless check in at Delhi Metro. However walk to gates situated far side at IGI may bother some people, the airline may think on that. but that was not a problem for me.

The Boarding Process was systemetic.
The Aircraft was well maintained and Clean, the seats had amazing comfort and well legroom for a tall person ( i am short btw so lots of space remained). The Cabin Fragrance was charming.

The Best thing was the Food. Mouth Watering and Delecious.
Never expected such amazing food in an airline.

The Service, Crew was exceptional.

The Ticket Fare was low compared to other Full Service Carriers on the sector.

All these add to An Excellent Experience.

Have to say that it was amazing experience. The Fare was cheap compared to other Full Service carriers and also provided better times.
The best was the service they provided.

The Check in at New Delhi Metro made the journey effortless. and the security at DEL took 5 minutes only.

So There fore 5 min Checkin + 5 min waiting for metro + 20 minutes journey to Airport + 5 minutes to Security another 5 in Security...

And there it was 40 Minutes to Airside Incl Travel.

Now Walk to the gate seemed to be long, but thats not a problem. Even with delay in deperture, arrived bagdogra before scheduled time.

The Best thing was The Food, The Service and the Clean and well maintained Aircraft ( VT-TTJ).

The Food Provided was delecious and tasty. The Inflight Magazine was nice.

Mary Margaret S wrote a review Oct 2018,20,Bagdogra - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Dishonest baggage policy,"The flight was fine and flight crew was accommodating. However I was disappointed by what I believe to be a dishonest baggage policy. On my first inter-India flight with Vistara, I checked my reasonably sized bag no problem and with no extra fee. On this flight, however, I was told my bag (which now weighed less) was overweight. I was prepared to pay the overweight fee. I was offered an upgrade to business class for something like the equivalent of $80 USD or premium economy for $25 in order to check my baggage.

Thinking I had no choice, I paid the $25. However, I later heard a friend of mine traveling on the same flight had mentioned she was traveling internationally and would later be on an international flight from Delhi. Vistara waived the baggage fee and said this is standard policy, as long as a customer brings it up first.

I don't feel I should have to know a secret password phrase like this in order to not be taken advantage of."
Nitin M wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Goa - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Unhygienic Food quality,I was quite impressed with my first flying experience with Vistara hence decided to again use Vistara from Goa-Mumbai journey. At Goa airport Vistara Kiosk wasn't working and could not identify my PNR number hence I had to go to check in counter to print boarding pass in spite of having only cabin luggage. Morning non veg snack box was served containing a chicken wrap and a muffin. Upon opening the box a live fly came out from the box. Most probably this fly was enjoying the muffin inside the box. After complaining to the crew member they quickly replaced the snack box and gave me printed apology letter which I think wasn't sufficient. Airline with tie up with Singapore airlines should be setting excellent standards in their customer service and also in providing hygienic meal to their gusts. as per Industry norms I should have been duly compensated for such a big issue but that did not happen.

I have also flown all the other domestics so I can genuinely make the comparison. Firstly, Vistara, even as a domestic carrier flies from the International terminals so the quality there is a little higher and more relaxed.

The flight is boarded in a relaxed manner so that people are not jammed in when trying to board. The flight attendants are first class and always have a smile. They are very efficient and caring of the passengers needs.

But one of the best things is that the airline provides nice meals as a standard feature.

They leave on time and arrive on time....what more could you want? The only slight drawback is that the airline does not fly all routes yet, However, for the ones they do? 10 out of 10 Vistara !!!!!"

I would like to mention that they have the policy to serve for children first. It was really a feel good factor for travellers with children. The hostess asked us for type of food and as mentioned earlier during my check in I asked for child food. But she told that child food is available only if you mentioned before 24 hrs from takeoff. I told her that I have mentioned it while selecting the seat. But she shows her inability and serve a veg meal. But after going back she might have checked and came back with child meal without much delay. I must say that the child meal beis having all dishes which a child may like.

A choice of chicken or vegetarian sandwich ,cookies and water was offered for the 50 minutes, 320 mile flight."

Vistara logo, its corporate colour, complimentary food was all good.
The best was two things, one was the in flight entertainment app for mobile phones and second was the premium economy kind of service. In all I found VISTARA experience more than satisfactory,ten out of ten.:-)"

Panchtattva wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Kolkata - New Delhi,Domestic,Business Class,Different experience due to ticketing team,Vistara has always been our favourite and trusted one when ever we travel. This time we chose business class. For luggage check-in we expericed a comperatively slow service. The lady who was in-charge forgot to give us boarding passes. We were travelling with an infant and after flight boarding we found our seats weren't together. That created some hassle not only to us but also our Co-passengers as flying with infants are not easy sometimes. Cabin crew team helped a lot. So no complaints for them.

dinam3ba wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Bengaluru - Ahmedabad,Domestic,Economy,Vistara Airline UK925,"I traveled Air Vistara recently and yes, it lived upto my expectations.

Firstly, it is a premium airline not a low cost carrier (LCC) like Indigo or Go Air.
Now cut to check-in, they have dedicated counters for all three classes viz. Economy, premium economy & business class. When counters for premium economy & business class are free they ask the passengers of the economy class queue to other counters for smooth passage & less chaos. They greeted me with a genuine smile & spoke courteously & politely unlike others where the scene is fake smile  with standard lines being spoken with no eye contact.
During boarding, you enter the aircraft you can feel a vibrant energy with smiles & bright white light instead of fluorescent lighting & welcoming crew with new color. The interiors is refreshing with leather seats with wing shaped head rests. I had enjoyed very well."

sidhuris wrote a review Sep 2018,20,New Delhi - Chandigarh,Domestic,Economy,FALL OF THE MIGHTY,"It was a great disappointment to travel by the so called premier airline of the country, having a very good pedigree of Singapore Airlines and the House of Tatas. The travel cost for a journey of less than 250 km was more than Rs.4,000 and the delivery was minimal. The boarding was started good 45 minutes before the take-off, with early get-ins cooling their heels in a hot environment. The Air-hostesses were most shabbily dressed, I do not know who has designed the dresses for them, which resemble those worn by nursing staff of one horse town hospitals. Some cold sandwiches were served during the flight and I rightly opted out as the passenger on the next seat rated them as very poor.

The landing was rather bumpy and no announcement was made of the number of belt from which the luggage could be collected.

Over-all, a very poor experience. They are rightly thinking of going into the budget airline mode, as they rightfully belong to that category only."
Deryl v wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Mumbai - New Delhi,Domestic,Premium Economy,"Calm, quiet and super comfortable","I flew home from an exhausting business trip on Vistara.
I rushed to the airport as I was worried that like when I previously took Indigo, I would have to stand in a long line of people pushing.
I walked in, the staff brought me straight to a vacant counter and before I knew it the check-in was complete and I had a lot more time the spend at the airport then expected.

The boarding was just a smooth. They asked the passengers to board in specific groupings. So things went fast.
While boarding I was offered a bottle of water, which was nice.
The seats are comfortable and the airplane was clean and looked new.

The crew and pilots made us all very comfortable and the experience was relaxing.
The food options were good and allowed for a super experience.

Just fly Vistara, they are levels above the rest."
Deryl v wrote a review Sep 2018,50,New Delhi - Mumbai,Domestic,Premium Economy,Travel in luxury for near budget prices,"At the check in the lines were already separated which made the experience extra pleasant from the start as I did not have to stand in line for a very long time. The check-in attendant was super friendly and the entire process was completed in literally less than 3 minutes.

The lounge offers a good variety of snacks and full meals and the quality was excellent.

I checked in also through separate lines and once I sat down a flight attendant asked if I wanted some water while boarding continued. The seats were clean and comfortable. I did a quick check of the rest of the airplane and it all seemed clean and in a very good condition.

Once we were in the air I was offered another drink and presented with a menu for the lunch options. The entire experience was surreal. As a frequent traveler, this was the first time I experienced business class style service for Premium economy seats. The staff all the way to the pilots were courteous and all about making the customers comfortable.
While in India Vistara is my airline of choice, instead of the Indigo that is like a sardine tin.

What got me was upon arrival they had a special line/ area for female passengers. I was blown away and absolutely loved it.
Great job Vistara."

The best thing about Vistara is I think has to be the leg space you get ample of leg room to sit comfortably and to relax. The food was good but quantity could be improved. I think there's only one thing which was missing for Vistara to become India's best airlines is that they don't have the In-flight entertainment .

The welcome on board was pleasant and the behaviour of the crew was excellent. They were taking care of everyone. Since the plane was new so we felt the difference of comfort. I think they have enchroached upon the space of one row which could have been left for leg space. The take off was good, the flight was good and the food was also good though in a very small quantity. They, if save money from the packing, can increase the quantity of food. This is my suggestion to them. I like their beautiful packaging of the food but the cost borne on this reduces the size of food. A very comfortable and lovely experience, though I could not get any of the front rows, but even then the journey was good. Thanks to Vistara."

The ground staff called in to resolve also seemed clueless, until some kind fellow passengers offered to swap seats. Once in the air, it was a peaceful flight.

The service from Vistara is amazing. There was complementary food even in economy class.
The quality of the flight and the behaviour if the cabin crews were simply superb.
The only issue I had faced was, the legroom was not adequate compared to other airline company's economy class.
Rest everything were absolutely amazing.
If you want good hospitality and smooth service, try Vistara."

As it turned out, it was a very sweet surprise and turned out to be pleasant experience in the end. The air-hostesses were refreshingly different , being a little less obtrusive and the ambience inside was truly different in terms of the feel and exquisiteness on account of several factors, the most important being the behaviour and approach of crew members."

Here you have an airline with best economy legroom, so far over 8 flights in an year no major delays (have had jet,spice, indigo all in one dleay or other), well groomed cabin crew, announcements you can hear and understand, small food servings frugally packed but well chosen not to be a dampner still giving you full service feel and now an in flight entertainment on your WiFi devices. Given the price they seem to be currently giving taste of experience to people before the can charge more. Well I guess an extra 20 percent would not be too much to ask as with current serving and ticket prices and 80% occupancy, sure they are sinking money.
It is still for me a Class you can expect from Singapore Airlinesand TATAs venture. Hope we see this one survive the hard competition in Indian Airspace and be the domestic Airline we can be proud of."

A light, tasty paneer snack for vegetarians, with pita bread, and dessert, one soft drink from a fair variety and Starbucks coffee.
The arrival was on tine, disembarkation was smooth, though we had to wait a while for the Gate at Delhi. The luggage was available on arrival as Premier Economy has priority baggage handling.

Jorge C wrote a review Sep 2018,50,New Delhi - Bengaluru,Domestic,Premium Economy,Go to airline in India,"Vistara is a great airline in India with hub in New Delhi. I fly vistara as much as I can when in India, between cities like HYD, BLR, CCU, AHM. All flights connect in Delhi . The premium economy is great with food selection off a menu and a dedicated flight attendant. I always book premium economy as the prices are really good. on occasion I upgrade to business for about 7500INR when checking in at the counter which allows me extra weight in checked luggage of course. Most airlines in India try to squeeze every buck out of you if your luggage is overweight, sometimes even weighing your carry-on; I have found that this is not the case with Vistara as they have not charged me for a few lbs of excess weight.

Airplanes are always sparkling clean and cabin crew is extremely polite even calling passengers by name.

My number one airline in India."

Flight was full. Managed the window seat on the emergency exit. Good leg space.

Clean take off and landing.

My issue was with the breakfast served, especially the veg fare. Poha, which was possibly kept too long in the oven, was bland and over dry. Moreover no ketchup or chutney or lemon to go along with it. Along with the poha was the suji ka halwa; somehow didn't quite click with my sensibilities or palate. The sweetened yoghurt and bun somehow satiated my hunger.

Why serve tea or coffee when your breakfast already covers your entire tray. Suggestion is to serve the hot beverage post serving breakfast.

Otherwise a decent flight"
salilchjpg wrote a review Sep 2018,50,New Delhi - Bagdogra,Domestic,Economy,An IDEAL Air Service Line,"We my wife 72 and myself 82, have to travel by Air almost every alternate month between our homes and that of my daughter and airlines being of the shortest time taking journey and free from political obstructions we have no choice but to stick to it. And naturally our experience varies from flight to flight and Airlines to Airlines.Must confess I was rather sceptic about vistara with a preconceived notion that it is just that a high-priced service with stiff upper lip. But while searching through flights available in the net I find that it was not at all a high priced and rather convenient in time for us. So I booked our flight in Vistara. Courtesy started at the check-in counter. The young lady there offered me one window and middle seat.we were happy. they helped us with our luggage. and helped us to our seats. These little 'Help's meant much for us. Real service started on flight. We were impressed by their personal care as to our comfort if it were alright with us etc. our country is a land of VIPs I heard we have nearly 6 hundred thousand listed an imaginable number in a civilized and a Democratic Republic. So as we are typically LIPs we never expect anything anywhere any attention and quite used to rude and curt treatment. So those polite inquiries touched us so much! The lunch on flight is a forgotten affair. We didn't pay for it. So such good and mouthful items was something unexpected. I remember once I could not get even a little water in spite of repeated requests. The Airlines are so keen on economising their services these days! So We thanked through air hostess the captain and all the on board staff and for everything. One more point to add. I suffer from acute ear ache during landing. But with this flt I didn't feel that much."

Poor customer service - I sense they do not consider their customers well at all from overall experience. Shame because I have had a good experience with Singapore Airlines directly - I expected more from a new carrier bearing their name as well as Tata.

Amarzeeth wrote a review Sep 2018,50,New Delhi - Chennai,Domestic,Premium Economy,Domestic Airlines - World class Feeling,"After travelling multiple times in Vistara (both Premium Economy & Economy) writing this review

Check in was smooth and there are absolutely no issues. Ground staff are helpful and they allowed some extra luggage even after free allowance.

As there are tight schedules between the connecting flights, most of the times i got delay for boarding. The simple reason was ""incoming flight delayed""

if that’s the case, I don’t understand why they schedule the flight with that tight schedule.

Once the aircraft reaches the airport, the refilling (De boarding, Boarding, fueling, food, cleaning) was done very quick and absolutely there are no issues.

They offer the boarding Business, Premium economy and economy.

Premium Economy :

Dedicated air hostess
Welcome Drink
Separate Menu (for Veg and Non Veg)
Sufficient Legroom
Comfortable seats
Premium Cutlery
Priority Boarding & de boarding
Economy :
Sufficient Legroom
Comfortable seats

If you plan to book the tickets well in advance, go for Premium Economy as there will be a very less difference in fare.

Because of the Traffic congestion at IGI Airport, waited almost one hour in the aircraft i hope this is because of ""incoming flight delayed"".

Vistara team worked very hard for the customer satisfaction. when the flight was delayed for almost 3 hours, they offered water bottles to the travellers.

This was great for the domestic airlines to offer something to get the customer satisfaction.

Food was excellent as this was owned by TATA and i feel food prepared specially for Vistara from TAJ.
Food Contains Bread, Butter, Salad, Dahi, Non Veg Meal, Desert, Juice, Water Bottle and of course Tea/ Coffee from Starbucks.

Crew was really good and helpful.

Overall very good domestic airlines offers world class treatment except for the delays for Incoming flight and Traffic Congestion."

As the flight taxied I was presented a menu with 3 options to choose from 2 vegetarian and 1 non vegetarian for my lunch
I opted for the vegetarian continental, the Oriental Vegetables with Fried Rice. Also accompanying it was a beautiful Chickpea Salad, a chilled rasmalai sort of pudding and a bread roll. A selection of cold drinks and juices is also available to go with your meal. And if that’s not enough you can further choose to end your meal with a Starbucks Coffee or Tea.

Anil T wrote a review Aug 2018,50,New Delhi - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Best Flight Experience,"Boarded the flight from Delhi. It is one of the most comfortable flight experience! There is ample leg space. The flight attendants are very genuine and kind. The air hostess had a very natural looking subtle makeup and not fake looking like the other airlines. Brilliantly presented themselves and had a very confident attitude.
The food served was exceptional though it was a simple Rajma Chawal with some chicken, a Red Velvet cake, bun maska and bottled water.
The seats are very comfortable and doesnt hurt your back.
Overall the experience was one which I will always prefer for all my travels.
Kudos Vistara Team !"

rads2k wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Chennai - New Delhi,Domestic,Premium Economy,Best of all the airlines and a class apart,This is a very personal experience of Vistara and having travelled by all airlines I find this airline more professional and friendly though a bit expensive than all other airlines. I hope they continue the way they are and not deteriorate in their services.

SnoopyDelhi wrote a review Aug 2018,20,New Delhi - Bengaluru,Domestic,Economy,"Poor time compliance, poor boarding staff","The flight was late by more than an hour, the handling of the delay was truly poor by the boarding staff. I wonder what makes the airline staff so rude and arrogant - perhaps it is the lack of a performance rating system so prevalent in ride-hailing services like Uber, Ola and most e-commerce retail and so completely missing in the airline industry.

The cockpit announcemeny by the pilot as well as cabin crew was unitelligible. In India, at one time, Kingfisher airlines did set the highest standards for such announcements, something that every other airline should have adopted as a good practice.

The quality of cutlery (provided in the food tray) was poor grade, the same tiny little bottle of water, the same rustic inflight experience that every economy class traveler has now come to tolerate in absence of a better standard.

I am disappointed and would not recommend Vistara as a preferred carrier."

Raja Chatterjee wrote a review Aug 2018,20,Hyderabad - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Very rude & unprofessional cabin crew (Inflight Supervisor Ms. Shakshi - UK858),"During booking of Flight UK858 (Hyderabad to Delhi) for 15th August'18, we already mentioned for Non-veg meal preference but your flight supervisor Ms. Shakshi denied to provide it. She was very arrogant and argued continuously with us in the presence of other fellow passengers. This was a very harrasing moment for us. We repeatedly told her to check the meal preference list but without checking she told us that we have not mentioned any meal preference. As we told her we would not have any veg meal, she was not giving us any meal and was agreed to bring the complaint book for us. To control the awkward situation the other cabin staff confirmed that she was having six extra non veg meals. In spite of this, she tried to prove that there was no meal preference mentioned in the list but after seeing carefully she confirmed that we had non veg meal preference and said she will manage to serve us any how. This type of harassment was not expected from a renowned airways. It can ruin the image/goodwill of Vistara."

jameel h wrote a review Aug 2018,10,New Delhi - Bengaluru,Domestic,Economy,Seats changed at airport,"Hey,

This airline only promises, but backs out in the last moment.
I had booked Delhi Bangalore ticket in July for my senior citizen parents. I had selected a meal option and seats 20 days before. They changed the seats while checking in. No prior intimation. And the way the counter staff treated us was also not good.
I got a call today from Vistara that the seats we selected were given to some one else who paid more than us. Seriously? Is that an explanation. Why do we get an option to select seats at all? And if we take all the pain and do it. it anyway gets changed, I see no point in flying this airline which is so unprofessional.
So people, be careful."
AbeMoosa wrote a review Aug 2018,40,New Delhi - Srinagar,Domestic,Economy,Very good upcoming airline,"I was expecting a cramped bucket seat type flight but we were pleasantly surprised by spacious economy seats,courteous and professional staff well dressed and the aircraft was clean.The snack that was served was delicious and filling and the juice was ok and one could also have tea or coffee complimentary.The return flight was equally pleasant.
The only annoying thing that had contributed to my early trepidation was the experience with booking agent Oppodo where they kept changing our booking times .I believe the staff are trained by Singapor airlines...keep it up Vistara when in India you are my travelmate!"
