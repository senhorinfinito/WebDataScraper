Rutvij wrote a review 9 Jul,10,Ahmedabad - New Delhi,Domestic,Premium Economy,Pathetic airline,"While web checking in they charged me 1,600/- for special seating arrangement for my parents. I was happy thinking they’d be more comfortable with extra leg space and facilities.

Shockingly just before boarding they’re told they cannot avail the allocated seats as they’re senior citizens. When I asked for the refund - naturally, since they themselves offered me the two seats on their own and charged me 1600/- - they blatantly declined saying it is non-refundable.

Really pathetic show from a TATA enterprise. Had my trust in Vistara brand until today - but it all broke now. They’ve proved themselves to be just some other two-bit thieves who want to siphon off innocent customers under the pretext of additional charges making utterly false promises.

Called up customer care over 5 occasions - and their executives make me wait deliberately keeping me on hold for more than half hour. Utterly disgraceful.

Vistara senior staff — if you give a damn and want to correct your fraud feel free to call me on 9930273377."

Sylvia wrote a review Jun 2021,10,New Delhi - Ahmedabad,Domestic,Economy,"""Terrible Experience with Vistara"". Never book the tickets from Vistara, at least for domestic","Mainly for the domestic flights, don't ever book from Vistara. I have booked round off journey for Ahmedabad-Delhi for a meeting with embassy authorities. Somehow it was postponed. I was needed a date change, which was absolutely wonderful with Indigo. But these guys were having only one flight for that day early in morning, which was not suitable. So even after requesting very much hard, they allowed me date change for second time.... sticking to their own principle, they don't want to return money because they find their own rules to adhered too and never understand customer's situation.

I thought TATA SONS could be a reputed one and even more user friendly. But it was ridiculous experience, even for buying ticket for much higher price, without availing the facility I lost my all money. They don't want to be flexible at all understanding the COVID Situation, something happens, It's not our fault."

Emails: There will only be automated acknowledgement for your emails but there will be no proper details or resolutions to your queries or grievances.

Staffs: They will be least concerned about your inconvenience. We had to stay in the airport for 14 hours over night to board another airline flight.

VISTARA cancelled the flight due to operational reason and rescheduled it for 24 Apr.

Then we were provided with a new date, 28 Apr and by that time UK government had put INDIA in Red country list. So I ended up cancelling the ticket and VISTARA very clearly told me the cancellation charge will be INR 27300 (almost £275). I paid £1952 for the tickets and in return got only £1334 as refund. Called the customer service more than 5 times and nobody has any clue what went wrong. Every time I was put on hold and then the call gets disconnected.
So even though it was not my fault but I ended up losing £650. Will not recommend the Pathetic flight."

Even at the airport the staff was arguiging over things that they didnt even know about. In times of worry like covid they can only add onto your stress levels.

I eventually cancelled my booking and booked with other airline as I couldnt deal with the stress levels. Rather pay extra than deal with such people.

Domestic-Vistara.International-KLM. It’s one PNR all the way.

My ticket did not include Check-In bag. When called up Vistara customer care they said they have a partnership with KLM so its sufficient for me to pay just 75 USD (for KLM) directly at the Chennai airport for my entire journey. Even KLM advised the same.
But at Chennai airport, Vistara staff did not listen to all this and made me pay INR 8050 just to take my check in bag from Chennai to Mumbai.Despite my numerous explanations, all I was told is that the Vistara customer care team gave me a wrong information.
NOW WHY SHOULD THE PASSENGER BE RESPONSIBLE and BEAR THIS ADDITIONAL BAGGAGE FEE if the mistake is made on Vistara customer care side. I had no option but to Pay-up!
When called customer care over phone to escalate the matter, they are re-confirming that I should not have been charged this extra Rs.8050 at the airport and just 75USD. Complaint no. TCT202103313573178.
A senior executive from Customer relations responded over my complaint. All he did was to re-iterate ""excess baggage has been charged as per the policy"".
They had no answer to my simple question-""Why was I given a wrong/misleading information that I need to pay check-in bag fee of 75USD for my entire journey but in the airport I was told otherwise and charged the excess fee of Rs.8050"".

1. They told me for connecting flight from Doha to Jammu, I don’t need to collect bags at Delhi, i will get it directly at Jammu. Which was incorrect and I found out otherwise at the check in time. This is a trip my wife was traveling with a 3 year old and a 6 year old. I would have made her stay extra day if I knew of the connection hassle.
2. They told me that I will get special assistance at the airport and will get a confirmation email or an acknowledgment on my request if I sent it through email. When I followed up about my email that now say it will take 24h to 48h for response while my wife is arriving Delhi in 3 hours time.
3. Traveling business class one would think entrainment system would be standard. I was so wrong. Not only did they not have a TV or screen. They had no wifi connected entertainment system either. My kids went through torture of a time.
4. The air hostess in the flight was so rude despite flying business class that her displeasure in serving my family was evident on her face.
5. Finally, at the Vistara counter they told us that they don’t provide service to drop off till connecting flight.

In lieu of the above, I would not recommend anyone to travel Vistara anytime.
Their customer service simply lies. You have definitely lost an international customer."

Flights were cancelled on both legs without intimation to us and no contact was made to rebook, which is an IATA requirement. The emails are non-functional and a single telephone contact portal ensures you are hanging on forever. If you are lucky to get through, the operators are not at all helpful.
Once airborne the service is not bad considering the COVID constraints.
It is the worst customer service experience I have had in all my flying years and would try to avoid this airlines in future, unless higher management take notice and radical changes happen.

Sahil Singla wrote a review Mar 2021,10,New Delhi - Chandigarh,Domestic,Economy,Terrible Check In experience with the airline staff and supervisor at Delhi airport.,"The check in staff was not informed on the baggage policy, made me wait for about 15 mins while she checked with someone on call. There was no response from the other line and she made a random decision to charge me for my carry on bag (INR 8000) which was apparently way more than the cost of ticket itself. Her supervisor (Seema) was just interested in moving the queue and she would not listen to the details of my booking. Eventually i was getting late for the flight and had no option other than to give in at that time to get my boarding pass.

More details:

I was flying from Chicago to Chandigarh and my domestic leg from New Delhi to Chandigarh was booked on United Airlines operated by Vistara. I had 2 check in bags + carry on bag + laptop bag, all under permissible weight limits and typical of an international flight from USA to India. I was not sure about the size of the aircraft in the domestic flight so I inquired if my carry on bag would fit in or not. They mentioned it won’t and even if it did it is above 7kg limit for a carry on bag and instead of taking the risk i should check in and pay fo 15kgs instead.
This was inspite of me showing them the vistara policy which had to honour the same baggage allowance for connections from international flights within 48 hrs.

Her recommendation was that i either magically get rid of my 8kg belongings or pay up to board the flight, given the departure time I had no option other than to pay up which I felt was completly unjustified. To make matters worse the supervisor on floor (Seema) was completly rude and interested in chatting up with her friends than pay attention to any questions from customers.

Fast forward, I boarded the flight,half empty and huge spaces for carry on bags in thr flights and knowing all that she still made me check in the bag for additional amount. I felt completly ridiculous and betrayed and I hope that the airlines invest some time in teaching manners and policies to their front end staff."

None of the Vistara staff said anything to any of the ones around me! If I come down with COVID-19, it will be entirely because of them!!

The food (advertised as hot meal on their website) was just an extremely cold tiny vegetarian puff of very average quality and two tiny cookies, with a small bottle of water. No juice, no tea or coffee. So what if their website boasts of great Starbucks coffee? Their website says I can pre-choose my meal. When I called cutomer care, they said that was not possible and I would only have to accept whatever was available. Why can they not update their website?

Boarding was supposed to commence at 08:55 but actually commenced at 09:25.

I was scheduled to fly back to Kolkata with them. I have now cancelled that ticket and booked an Indigo flight. In August and September last year, Indigo was impeccable.

Both parties failed to respond in due course and offered a refund of 486 rupees for a flight of 3699.

At the airport they took signature if any loss they not liable

Finaly before getting boarding pass they refused my kids entry because kids were having tourist visa. 5 and 7 year old.

They said i can dump my children at airport fly on my own

Lost around 3000 pounds. Every single vistara staff are lauging and watching me and children runing around all over the airport.

It was most terrible experience received by Vistara.

Before booking with this airline please call me i will explain more. Karma will have them back.

So they threw people who had booked those seats wherever they felt like, with not even the courtesy to inform them. Shame on them for such greed."

Ishan6987 wrote a review Dec 2020,20,Bhubaneswar - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Worst airline in terms of COVID safety and staff behaviour,"Hello fellow travellers,

As an aviation expert and ex- aviation staff i mist say that this airline is not at all professional and safe to travel during this pandemic. First of all they don't follow the protocol of safe distancing and the in-flight service is substandard. If you are planning any trip to india or abroad with this airline then be careful to experience the same. Vistara was on my high end expectations after Jet Airways went out of business, however this airline is not even equal to the standard of Indigo - The best LCC in india. The staff in this company are pretty much clueless and the tone they use to treat customers is way too rude. I think the airline should start providing communication classes to its staff.
I have travelled this airline few times and everytime i was disappointed by some or the other factor. As per my experience i would rate this airline as the worst airline in India."

The pilot was communicating with the passengers, showed the Himalayan range through the plane windows. I specifically want to write about Tuli. She was an air hostess attending passengers in the plane. She was very warm and humble. Asked me if I was felling comfortable after short intervals.

officialdaringdeepika wrote a review Nov 2020,10,Mumbai - Amritsar,Domestic,Economy,Worst Ground Experience(Mumbai Airport),"Hello there!!!
This is with regards to my flight UK 994. I must say, This is the worst flight experience I have ever had. Starting from check-in , in -flight & security, I seriously felt Vistara has stopped believing in Customer relation service!
I would like to mention Rujal , Arun ,Avinash & Ana(Ground staff) who do not know how to solve customer issues!! Why have I mentioned these four names because being seniors in their hierarchy they all assumed they have paid for customers' tickets and they could play with them around !! I mean instead of finding a solution they straight away asked me to cancel my ticket!
As soon as I went to the counter for check in I just asked them how much allowance I have for baggage because my family travelled several times through Vistara and they could have carried 20kg due to Covid or whatever!!!! But what I learned is that I can travel with one piece for 15kg! Fair enough!!I tried to shuffle a few things in my hand baggage which was almost empty. But As per policy there is some limitation to carry liquid in hand bags as I was carrying a few liquid bottles and so they could have adjusted  my handbag weight in the check in bag. And it’s not that I was not ready to pay for  extras, but asked them to adjust two -three kg!
First thing I did was travelling to attend a marriage which I have mentioned to staff and cant leave any of the stuff here but  they have suggested me to calI someone to come to the airport to take back my extra kgs which could be adjusted in a hand bag!!! Which they didn’t allow me to do.Secondly I have told them that  I am not carrying enough money so allowed me to carry a few kgs extra in a check in bag since I don’t have much in hand!!!Thirdly,  they kept sending me from one person to another!! I was making my fool talking and waiting for their response!Literally I was running behind them and I got so angry when your staff Rujal was making fun of me with her other employees and I could read her lips that she abused me!These are heights and specially Arun and Avinash seem more interested to hear Rujal’s instruction rather than listening to me!!!Ana was at-least professional but she was more interested to cancel my booking.
I think you should train your staff how to handle customers. This is absolutely not the way to treat a lady travelling alone, instead of helping, they were rude and abusive. This has given mea traumatic experience!!

I seriously regretted booking this flight ,I could have taken Air India as their member too!!
Mumbai to Delhi cabin crew were good but Delhi-Amritsar crew were also so annoying!!, I  mean was eating and no one would have worn a mask while eating. but one of the crew was so rude and ordered me as if she was a teacher ..I mean,There is always a way to inform!! One of my worst flight experiences so far!!"

They then lied about why the flight had been cancelled (saying it was due to debris on the runway when it wasn’t, this was confirmed by another airline). This was before Covid had even begun. Currently, the way airlines and travel agencies have been treating customers during Covid says a lot and you only need to look at the reviews on here to see that Vistara has NO integrity and doesn’t care about its customers AT ALL!!! Unfortunately I have seen first hand how Vistara take your money then no longer care what happens to you. Please avoid this airline if you don’t want to lose your hard earned cash. This airline is worst than budget airlines so it’s a joke that it calls itself a “luxury” airline. If I could only give it 0 stars I would."

Pramesh Bajracharya wrote a review Sep 2020,10,Chennai - Kathmandu,Asia,Economy,They are the worst. I now know which airline not to choose.,"I booked another ticket from Vistara and it was canceled by them (NOT BY ME).

But, this useless airlines has no intention of refunding my tickets (by no means - no credit shells as well). It took me 5 hours to get through their customer care and the guy simply answers that there will be no refund. WTF?

What was my fault here? How is this fair first of all? Can airlines even do this? What about the rule from the government that said - refund should be provided if the flight has been canceled from the airline side? And mainly, what about this - “The policy of the Central Government is that every individual passenger has a right to seek refund of those tickets, the flight for which was canceled without any fault of his/hers. It is stated that non-refund of fare amounts to violation of provisions of the CARs,” the DGCA addressed the court. Doesn't this mean they are violating the law? Somebody needs to scrutinize them I tell you.

I am in distress and I wonder how many people faced this. What about other people? 15K is a huge sum.

Curse vistara airlines. Just go and learn something from Indigo. I booked with Indigo and they refunded the full amount without me contacting them.

And on the other note, when calling your customer service, how dare you to call yourself as best airlines in India? Was it supposed to make us laugh? Shame on you.

At the end of the day, if you treat your customers like this then do no expect to run properly. I literally despise you guys now. I hope you follow the faith of Jet airways and go bankrupt soon.

3. The Manager in Dubai was Also helpful (I don't remember her name )
4. The other supervisor - Dubai ( Brayan ) not sure about the name ) refused to help, when requested and asked for him to share the Same via E-mail he agreed to help.

They said through check-in till Chennai
Mumbai after clearing the immigration one of the Vistara staff approached and Said i can't take the connecting flight and was trying to stall me in Mumbai coz the Mumbai health workers has to allow without getting Quarantined -
RT PCR test report negative .
Rapid test report negative.
Self declaration for exemption for home Quarantine for 14 based on the RT PCR test
E-pass to travel back home in Chennai.

Had to argue with the Vistar staff and supervisor and the health workers and their supervisors - just heartless and rude , who couldn't speak English ( Hindi is not India's National Language ) and i had to tell them to stay away not to come near me.

SOCIAL DISTANCE NORMS WHERE NOT FOLLOWED AT ALL . ALL THE 4 HEALTH WORKERS WERE AT THE SAME SMALL DESK .

After screaming and yelling at the so called health workers they let me get out to the next gate where my connecting flight was at 9 am and they told me to wait at the entrance because i can only go in after they open the counter at 6. Another round of yelling and screaming they let me in . During the next security check . The CISF personal said i can't carry battery for my device and had to be in the check-in luggage . After arguing and talking to the Asst.Comm of CISF they let me go ( bunch of people working without understanding the basics and commonsense )

Social distancing was followed

BOM - BLR - NOT FOLLOWED
BLR - MAA - PACKED FLIGHT NOT FOLLOWED

Why act when the flight is in the international bountries saying we are following the physical distancing ??

When i booked it was DXB - BOM : BOM - MAA

I got a call concerning the safety of the passengers they are made me stop twice and full flight .

Service should be rendered on need bacis or when requested not after arguing and demanding .

Just hope less apart from the few managers who helped .

People just be careful when you are booking their own connecting flights ..

Vistara = -1000

Worst service"
P Ravi S wrote a review Aug 2020,30,Mumbai - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Average flight,I checked in online and baggage handling was smooth. Vistara does not keep the middle seat vacant. The person in the middle seat is given PPE. The flight was a bit late taking off. There was absolutely no food or beverage service during the flight. I think airlines are using the pandemic to cut costs. They had an entertainment streaming service but I did not use it. There was some turbulence. The flight landed in Delhi on time.
Niki S wrote a review Aug 2020,10,Ranchi - Newark,International,Economy,Disappointing Airline,This airline takes booking and then cancels at the last moment leaving the passengers to make their arrangements. I had a connection from Delhi to Newark. Vistara has partnered with United Airlines for this connection. Canceling my Ranchi to Delhi flight at the last moment left me to do too many things in too little time. I will avoid Vistara in future.
shruti wrote a review Jul 2020,10,Bengaluru - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,"Worst airline with the worst customer service , robbing people's money by taking advantage of the covid crisis","I had booked a ticket from Bangalore to Mumbai on 22nd June. Vistara customer service is worst. It provided wrong information regarding the extra baggage purchase and mede me pay extra money and buy it. After 2 days they cancelled the flight from their end and when contacted regarding the refund they refused to provide it blaming the whole situation on COVID. How can they rob passengers hard earned money and keep it by not providing any service. Their agent had called me saying at least the extra money i had paid for baggage will be refunded, but it was a lie, they did not respond when contacted and most of the time they pretend as if they do not understand the customers problem. They rob big amount from passengers for free like this taking advantage of the Covid situation.This was the first time i booked in this airline and will be last. I highly recommend not to book on this airline if you do not want to be cheated by them."

Gujrat government had shut down all institutions and travel places hence I had to cancel my trip as well as this flight. Vistara appellate authority has confirmed on the email for full refund but Ease My Trip says they have not received the refund. When I call Vistara cutomer care they say refund has been given to EMT but when I connect to EMT they say they have not recieved the refund, now who is lying in this case??

souvik_5 wrote a review Apr 2020,50,New Delhi - Kolkata,Domestic,Economy,India's Best Airlines!,"In March 2020, I had the sudden opportunity to fly with Vistara with my entire family. For the rest of the members, it was their first time flying with them. It was a last-minute booking made at the airport. We had a really bad day since the morning and all of us (including the 2 kids) were under a lot of stress. But that started to change the moment we stood for checked in. Seeing that we were a large group, the customer service member immediately took us to a counter that had only 2 persons in front of us. The person who checked us in was very courteous and explained us each & every important details of the boarding pass as if we were flying for the first time (unbeknownst to him, it was in fact my 107th flight) :) He couldn't confirm whether meal is included in the ticket though. For that I called the customer service phone number and after almost no wait time got through a nice customer service representative who cleared our doubts promptly. The boarding commenced on time and it was done in a very smooth and orderly manner. Right at the door of the aircraft we were greeted by friendly cabin crew, who took special care in bringing smile to my little daughter. I was surprised to experience the fresh look and feel of the cabin. I, then, looked up the registration of the aircraft (VT-TNW) and found that we were about to fly in just a 3 months old aircraft :O The seat back was loaded with features to hold all possible items, the seats were comfortable and squeaky clean. We started the push back right on time and after we took off, the cabin crew started serving dinner with great efficiency. When I enquired about the menu choices, the extremely friendly cabin crew showed us the actual content, which we loved. Now my son hates rice and doesn’t eat that ever. But other than the small bread roll, the meal tray did not have much carbohydrate options left for him. He is a great fan of paneer though. But smelling the really nice aroma of the pilaf, which was in the same container with paneer curry, he could not resist himself. He started taking both pilaf and palak paneer curry with the spork! He liked it so much that he even finished another plateful of pilaf and rice!! I could not believe my own eyes! My daughter also liked the food but she was more interested in watching the movie Frozen in my phone, which I was streaming from the IFE. It played flawlessly during the entire duration of the flight. The cabin crew was one of the friendliest I’ve met in all the Indian carriers. They made eye contacts, smiled back when smiled at and took genuine care of the passengers. My apologies for not asking and noting down their names during the journey.

The entire journey was extremely smooth and it helped us in releasing all the stresses that accumulated throughout the day. The plane stopped at the gate at CCU airport 2 minutes before time :) I was quite thrilled by getting such a world class service at economy class. My daughter, who is not a great fan of flying due to the ear pain that she gets during take-off and landing, even said that flying by Vistara was the top 3 memories of our 6-day trip.

I know that right now you are going through very difficult times due to COVID-19. But know this - my family is eagerly waiting for you to start the Dreamliner service post COVID-19. We are hoping that you will be starting the service to one of the UK/European destinations. If the fares are close to the competitors, we’ll be surely trying to “fly the new feeling” in the Business Class of your brand new 787-9!"

Even as they spoke to each other, I sensed a pleasant and respectful vibe, which is a basic humane etiquette. But unfortunately, this essential trait is found lesser and lesser in many other airlines. It was quite refreshing to find such compassion and kindness after years of travelling. Thumbs ups to the cabin crew of Vistara and please do keep up the better work. Thank you."

Jyoti L wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Kochi (Cochin) - New Delhi,Domestic,Premium Economy,Special meal disappointment,"I requested a gluten free meal as I’m a celiac and strictly on a wheat free diet. Initially the ground staff told me I had it in my profile whereas the crew said they had a GF meal but were not aware if it’s mine.
Finally the meal came and it was made of soyabean(a wheat product ). I was aware so I could get it changed. Someone like my mom who is allergic as well can not spot the difference and would’ve suffered a reaction. The crew understood my problem and gave me an alternative but blunders like this can be fatal. I hope the airline is conscious about such mistakes and doesn’t repeat them."

TapanKB wrote a review Mar 2020,50,New Delhi - Kolkata,Domestic,Economy,Good Airline and no nonsense service,"We took a round trip on this airline and this was our first experience on Vistara. This Tata-Singapore Airlines jointly owned domestic airline is good, efficient and has a no-nonsense service. We were pleased, especially, somebody like me, who has been flying within India for over 40 years, from the days when India had only one airline, Indian Airlines, owned by the government, which was a horror and terror show, in the old days."

Lopa Bhatt wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Dubai - Mumbai,International,Economy,Class apart,"One of the better Airlines to fly with - prompt updates and info, interesting loyalty program, affable staff, better interiors and hospitality. Strangely though, it’s typically late by half to one hour at take-off (mostly blaming this on airport permissions and traffic congestion) and this has happened to me 4 times in past quarter or so. At the time of check in, there’s no such alert or info but it tends to lag behind schedule in taking off."
R1chardN wrote a review Mar 2020,30,Lucknow - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Okay for a short hop,"The flight was about 75% full and so was quite comfortable. The seats were sufficient for a short flight and the leg room satisfactory. We were served a snack which was not necessary - we were in the air for about 50 minutes.
This is an internal flight but is used by tourists who have taken international flights to get to India and have sufficient luggage for the duration of their holiday. The allowance of 15k per person is inadequate and so be prepared to pay excess baggage. If you are taking an international flight within 24 hours there seems to be some discretion to increase the allowance to the usual 25k.
The check in process at the airport is chaotic and we had at least three body checks before we got on the flight. This included a final check immediately before we boarded the bus to take us to the plane.
If only there was an easier alternative way of making this journey."
Sahilbanga wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Mumbai - Dubai,International,Premium Economy,Best Experience,"Vistara has redefined the flying experience in the Indian domestic sector with a unique offering and service levels. I wouldn't think of any other airline if I am travelling within India. However, I experienced their hospitality on an International route, and I was extremely pleased with the service levels. Their aircrafts are neat & clean, the food options available are amazing and staff is prompt. The Economy Premium is much better option as the leg room is better, they give you extra baggage option and priority check-in and baggage delivery. The in-flight entertainment system was unique - they give you a wifi access to watch movies on your own device. That gives us total privacy to watch entertainment content."

Rajeev57 wrote a review Mar 2020,50,New Delhi - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Very Good flying Experience,"Everything about this airline is very good - except the check-in. At Delhi Airport recently, after doing web check-in and printing the boarding pass at the kiosk, I had to spend more than 45 minutes just for baggage drop. The reason - only one baggage drop counter was manned, defeating the very purpose of the automated check-in. The airline should ensure that such delays do not take place, as these spoil the otherwise very good experience."
Sudhir M wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Ahmedabad - New Delhi,Domestic,Premium Economy,Vistara needs more flights from Ahmedabad,"The flight boarded on time but there was a 20 minute delay on ground because of air congestion at Delhi. This has happened earlier also on Vistara flights from Ahmedabad to Delhi. No fault of the airline which may like to relook at the schedule to accommodate such delays.
It is a fine airline and I have always enjoyed flying with them. Premium Economy is a great innovation for those who do not wish to splurge on Business but want more comfort than Economy. I wonder why Vistara does not fly between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, there are more than a dozen flights every day but none of Vistara.
2 suggestions: Vistara has been playing the same music at the time of landing and takeoff for the last 3-4 years and it is getting monotonous. Also please serve Starbucks on all flights and not only on more than 90 minutes duration flights."

I had to take my medicines and I asked a stewardess for a glass of water. She heard and looked away but did not respond. About half an hour later, when another stewardess was serving breakfast, a glass of water was provided, but with the food and my half an hour gap between my medicine and breakfast was extended further.

Maybe Vistara will be my last resort in future. Rules are rules.....!

Hitesh wrote a review Mar 2020,20,Singapore - New Delhi,Asia,Economy,Worst experience with Vistara,I was travelling from Singapore to New delhi in the month of december. Travelling with vistara was my first expierence and most probably the last also.I have heard a lot about vistara and was very excited to travel.But when I boarded the plane I was very disappointed as they have no screens for entertainment.Seats were not comfortable. Food was very very compromising. Service was really bad.They served food and liquor together.food was very bad.tjey indeed provided the inflight entertainment which one can use in their mobiles but that was very slow and in half used to get stuck.My overall experience was very bad.No international standards at all.I really miss Jet airways.If one is tevelling in vistara kindly note two things ... First eat well before boarding and second downlaod good stuff in mobile to kill the time.

Abhi wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Austin - Pune,International,Premium Economy,Worst flying experience for my family,"So I booked a flight from Austin to Pune (PNQ) which had a international to domestic change at Delhi international airport. I thought how hard could that be. it will be better for My 10 month old baby to travel domestic in India rather than drive from mumbai to pune (which takes 2 hours)
But as it turns out my decision was the worst decision in terms of choosing flights.
It was great from Austin to Delhi. But as soon as we landed, things got bad. Vistara airlines just didnt care that me and my wife were travelling with an Infant.
We got immigration done, got our bags and headed to domestic transfer and reached vistara baggage counter.
There were still 45MIN LEFT for the flight to depart (about 30 MIN for GATE CLOSE).
Usually the counter tells the customers that no this time is not enough for you to travel from this counter to the gate (Because Delhi airport is LONG LONG walk AND WITH a 10 month INFANT it was IMPOSSIBLE).
But the vistara agent decided to not mention that and told us to run to the gate.
At that point, I thought since we put our bags in the agent will PHONE IN to the gate that we are headed to the gate... But NO. We run to the GATE with THE INFANT AND THEY CLOSE THE GATE ON US!!!!!!
Yes, WE WERE ONLY 1 MIN LATE THEY SAID... WE BEGGED THEM TO LET US IN... THEY COULD HAVE WAITED 5 more min/CALLED IN THE BAGGAGE COUNTER TO ASK ABOUT US!
Then I realized its no use after they started giving me ridiculous reasons.
Then they dragged us back to the check in counters which was a LONG WALK BACK... GREAT.
Then they tell us that the next flight is after 5 HOURS and... the best part... they cannot guarantee the tickets (on hold) because its not the policy???
SO I DONT KNOW IF I HAVE TICKETS FOR THE NEXT FLIGHT!!!!
VISTARA THEN MAKES ME BUY THE FLIGHT TICKETS (RS 30,000)
Now I understand that international to domestic change in India is the worst...
I think Vistara just didnt think this possibility through..."

1. Roundtrip tickets booked from Bagdogra to Sydney via Vistara (domestic) and Singapore Airlines(International) on a single PNR.

2. On the return leg, SIA checked my parents up to Delhi for an onward connection to Vistara.

3. Severe crowds at Delhi airport baggage claim and immigration delayed my parents.

4. No on ground staff from Vistara to assist or enquire.

5. They issued boarding passes for Bagdogra just in time; but my parents couldnt catch their flight due to crowd delays through security at Delhi Airport.

5. Vistara flatly refused any arrangements and repeatedly blamed us for booking a ""tight connection""

6. Their representatives were rude and uncooperative and my parents were left to fend for themselves.

7. Baggage returned after more than 2 hours.

7. Tired and exhausted, they booked an Air Asia Flight.

8. Their customer relations - International connection: Zero customer service, nightmarish experience, heartless airline, nodal officer - Nishant Khanna and Appellate Authority- Pooja Paul didn't care to respond to my email.

9. Logged a case with AirSewa and they responded immediately with a standard excuse "" We do not have control on airport security/immigration.....etc""

We thought it night be just once happening but again during retire journey, we had same nice experience.

Also it is worth to tention about in-flight entertainment on mobile. Nice you download and register your self on Vistara world app, then once on-board you can open that app and using available vistara wifi, enjoy movies,
Shows etc for hours together without interruption.

Overall nice experience. But aircrafts from inside are now looking worn out. Vistara must do something about it soon.

Bluecann wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Bangkok - New Delhi,Asia,Economy,Lousy Feeling!,"I took UK122 from Bangkok to Delhi on 7th February. As I normally do, I had checked in online and also had a confirmed seat number.

When I arrived at the airline counter, and received my boarding pass, I noticed my seat number had changed. I was not told so by the check in person. Never happened in over 30 years of traveling, I asked for the reason. The check in person at Vistara blamed it on the system.

Not convinced, I kept pressing. He then responded that he had changed it because another passenger wanted that seat. That was a shocking response. I insisted on getting my confirmed seat back (as I was sitting with the rest of my family). It created chaos and finally I was asked to see the manager before boarding when I got my old seat back.

After my return, I wrote to Customer Service about this incident as well as the slow inflight service, rude check in staff at Delhi airport and the general violation of flight safety rules. I received a general, pre-packaged and standard response about the philosophies of customer service without addressing any of the specifics I had mentioned.

I wrote back and said so. I received another general, pre-packaged and standard response which still did not explain what had happened. I can only assume my specific feedback with dates, flight numbers has been ignored under the guise of a standard response.

After this experience and how Customer Service has handled my complain (more like ignored it), it’s hard to imagine that Singapore Airlines and TATA are backing this airline.

My take is that the customer service expectations from airlines in India are so low, given the damage caused by Air India, that Vistara was a welcome change for domestic flights. But, on international flights, Vistara is up against the best airlines, and its ‘Air India’ philosophy and culture will not work. I will certainly avoid it next time.

Vistara needs to transfer the best practices from Singapore Airlines and not the culture of failed airlines in India. Otherwise, remain a domestic airline and try to be the ‘relative best’."
DineshBhasin wrote a review Feb 2020,30,New Delhi - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Good to travel by Vistara but it seems to be going Jet airways.

She was busy completing her job( serving snacks) as per SOP( Standard Operating procedures) and although she said she will look into it, she didn't despite reminder. On one side Vistara takes pride in advertising the inflight WiFi, it doesn't work in domestic flights that well as it does internationally. Thats fine but what prevents the Airhostess to inform the actions taken on a complaint? Not even on this flight, on my earlier flights also, I have started seeing 'rudeness' in there behaviour. Hence I say, they are going Jet airways way. But, then, jet was a leader for many years. Success has gone into Vistara staff rather earlier. While serving coffee, even a tissue was not offered. It was placed rather rudely on my table, as if she is doing a favour."
Binal wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Ahmedabad - New Delhi,Domestic,Premium Economy,One of the worst Experience,"We booked the ticket being a gold member for 3 of our family members. it was booked in a premium economy class. we paid almost 25k for 3 tickets from Ahmedabad to Delhi

We were not sure about the dates but we still booked in an impression that, being a gold member and premium economy we can change dates in certain situation.

Due to unavailability of holidays given to my parents as they are government servant, We have to change the dates of the flight. We called customer care and he told us that each ticket will cost around 7k for date change. insane. my new ticket for that date was costing me 5k. we ended up taking a new ticket with Air India now.

At the end, they did not agree for a date change complimentary or with some minimal cost, we have to cancel all 3 tickets and we lost almost 20k with that tickets. Now we are getting refund of 1.7k on each ticket.

They dont care or show a courtsey for gold members. what they must be doing for regular customers.

We asked him to approach some one senio but it did not happen.

AVOID AWFUL VISTARA wrote a review Feb 2020,10,New Delhi - Ahmedabad,Domestic,Business Class,Cheap Airline - Pathetic Customer Service - Low Quality Staff,"At the time of booking we requested a wheelchair as I was travelling with my 80+yrs mother. But wheel chair wasnt provided.

They made my 80+yrs mother to walk upto gate 41. When we were at gate 39, next to gate 41, I received a phone call from Vistara personnel asking about our whereabouts, I mentioned to him that we were walking past gate 39 and will be at gate 41 in less than 30 seconds and he replied come over. When we reached the gate, we rushed to the counter and handed our boarding passes to the attendant. The attendant was on the phone and didn’t give a damn about us. The attendant’s name is Kalyani, absolutely untrained, unprofessional and unethical pathetic makeup clad girl. She did not look at us and kept on talking on the phone. From the conversation that I overheard I realized that she was instructing somebody to offload our bags. The guys present there even said to her that let these people board the plane but she was busy flirting with the person on the phone along with work related conversation. One person also mentioned that you just let that person go a few seconds ago then why not these guys but she ignored. I said to her that we are on this flight and if she could let us go and then continue chatting over the phone but she did not pay any attention. Kalyani intentionally did not allow us to board the plane, most probably to satisfy her low esteem ego. There was still time yet she tried to show her importance to us and took this step. Once the plane was pulled back that’s when she spoke with us saying that the plane has left and thus we cannot get on the plane though we were already there in advance. Is this what Vistara trains their staff for? I believe your business is all about the people and if you don’t take care of people then there will be always somebody else who will.

Then from the boarding door, appeared four people working for Vistara, out of which one recognized himself as Gaurav, the manager, and he said to Kalyani with a smile that put these people on the next flight at no charge, so first get them out of here and then ask them to reenter. A guy with wheelchair showed up then and asked my mother to sit, I asked him where would he be taking us and he said out of the airport, I said no we wont be going anywhere from here, why do we need to repeat the whole process when we are the same people.

In the meantime, Kalyani started to act like being busy and after about 10 minutses, I requested her to issue our boarding passes for the next flight to AMD and she said that she doesn’t have that ability, we will have to exit and reenter and then get our new boarding passes from the ticketing counter. This is not what Gaurav, who recognized himself as manager said. So I requested to speak with Gaurav but Kalyani wouldn’t ring her or give us his number. On repeated requests she rang him but Gaurav refused to talk with me because he realized that he had misled us with his sweet talk and released the weigh off his shoulders.

Feeling helpless and left stranded by the new awful feeling Vistara staff, I went to information desk to find out more information. I was advised that if we exit then we wont be able to reenter the airport without a valid ticket, so the Vistara guys have misinformed & misled you. You should be accompanied by a Vistara staff then only they will let you go out through security and advised not to go out of the airport. After which one of the airport buggy car guys accompanied us and spotted Gaurav, the manager and confronted him about misleading us and that is when Gaurav changed his story and started telling lies. What kind of managers does Vistara appoint who are so irresponsible and afraid of taking the ownership of the task? Are you trying to repeat the tata nano success story? You guys should be ashamed of yourselves for treating passengers like this. Gaurav’s plan was to get us out of the airport so that we cannot reenter and have to buy a new ticket to reenter the airport and this means that he has one less thing to manage. Seems this is how Vistara has trained and taught managers to treat passnegers? I think such guys within your company should be paid a bit extra so that they can shop around and buy some “Shame”, if their parents haven’t taught them.

We were then accompanied by a Vistara staff and we were brought to the ticketing counter. On approaching the ticketing counter, I explained them the whole situation after which they were asking us to pay a full fare for the next flight. I said to them that the guy named Gaurav, who recognised himself as a manager said that there will be no cost and they said that we do no have any manager by the name of Gaurav and then they asked me his last name. I explained them that this Gaurav guy is the one who met us at the gate and from the looks of it he is responsible for the dispatch of the flights. The guy said I don’t know any Gaurav who’s a manager with us. What kind of staff you guys have got where staff refuse to recognize other staff members? Then he rang the same Gaurav that I was talking about and spoke with him and after the phone call they asked us to pay INR 1000/person. I mentioned that we were being told that there would be no charge and the response we received was go and get that Gaurav and ask him to do it, we did not knew where this guy would be neither this guy would tell us about his current location. This meant that the guy knew this Gaurav but was acting that he didn’t knew him. Spare an award for this guy at your next annual function. Upto a certain extent Gaurav also realised that a mistake was done on their part by not letting us board the plane. Nowhere there is any information about gate closing time before the departure. The next flight was next day morning. They made us wait 12hrs and when we agreed to pay INR 1000/person to issue new boarding passes they again changed the story that we will have to wait upto 5am and if there are any seats left then they will be able to accommodate us.

Such a cheap illegitimate wat to get money out of the customers, this indeed is a new way of flying, firstly by not allowing to board the plane though it was possible. Later, on speaking with one of the Vistara staff members, it was revealed that because you were on a special discounted fare they did all this drama to get more money out of you guys. My mother has cursed your airlines and the people who misled and misinformed us which led to this hardship, from the bottom of her heart. Your airline wont last long. Another magnificent failure of tata after tata nano. About 40 percent of the flight's seats were vacant, that tells the whole story of the awful feeling people get by flying with Vistara.

We were put through unnecessary hardship & stress as a result of the mismanagement, miscommunication, misinforming customer, customer misleading and customer embezzlement.

It is quite certain that we will never fly again with Vistara even if offered for free, a mismanaged airline and will not recommend to family, friends, colleagues and neighbors."

Now we learnt of this class- ECONOMY LITE.
Let me tell you what it means:

1. The seats in the rear only- Rows 20 and beyond
2.No fresh food- a very poor choice from what you can purchase - basically packaged foods.
3. No change or even UPGRADE by paying the difference on this ticket.

I finished my appointments in Mumbai sooner then expected and came to the airport
to catch an earlier flight.
This is not permitted on this ticket class- so had to wait at the airport for 3 hours,

Lastly the fare is non refundable except the taxes paid.

It just isn't worth it - just the regular economy ticket is a better option."

IFly Aviation wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Bhubaneswar - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,"A solid ""-5"" star's without hesitation","Alright, Firstly i was so extremely happy about flying Vistara yesterday (in reference to January 2nd 2020) and i still was until Boarding, Me being a blogger and reviewing flights this was a big chance for me to actually make the best content to put out there for my audience as Vistara is a very blogger friendly airline! But it wasn't even 5 seconds that i was on the aircraft (VT-TNW) which by the way me being an aviation enthusiast knew that this Aircraft wasn't even 15 days old, Upon Boarding i received a very unwelcoming greet and the IFS was doing something else and could,nt care less either!! it wasn't long that i was walking through the Business Class cabin when i hear the Crew member tell me that recording or pictures aren't allowed, Now since when has this started that you guys have come up with such a thing, anyways regardless i went to my seat in Economy and the same happened! The Crew at the overwing exit came to me and asked if i was a blogger i responded saying,"" Yes, i'm an aviation enthusiast"" she went on to explain me the new seat features to which i felt amazing many Airlines lack such friendliness, however before the conversation even started she told me that taking pictures or videos where not allowed (Now weather i get an explanation for this or not i'd like to add that you advertise yourself's to be very blogger friendly and telling a blogger to stop his/her camera work is extremely disappointing) now coming to the service, It was dreadfully slow! The Crew where the last to respond to a passenger call bell even when they saw the light they could'nt care less about responding to it! And the Vistara world IFE wouldn't work on my phone either! However the north eastern Cabin Crew at the back was provably the only one who performed the best and was smiling at the passengers all throughout the flight and was friendly, No one else in the Cabin was smiling or performed the best as her and the other crew at the overwing exit i was taking about? She was extremely casual and unprofessional at all times! A incident even came up when i was waiting to use the washroom and she was saying that,"" What all have you recorded? Could i see the footage?"" now i fully respect the crew and pax privacy and i blur out their faces and i only don't blur out whenever they tell me it's alright. But i felt like a CISF personal was questioning me when i heard that, I was happy to fly that Aircraft which is brand new but the Crew sure where not! When i deboarded i could sense that the Crew just wanted to get raid of me and the other passengers, Vistara has never been great with bloggers lately and i sadly felt it yesterday but don't get me wrong because on the 26th of Oct i flew UK927 to which i absolutely loved the experience so much that the Crew even out staged the world's best Airline Qatar Airways when it came to the experience! And they definitely out staged the Vistara's service standards to such an extent that it actually became unbeatable to compare any Airline with Vistara. But nothing was the same on my yesterday's flight UK788. The Quality was so poor that neither Tata nor Singapore Airlines would have accepted it, If you praise yourself's saying that your the ""only 5 star Airline in India"" then do live up to it or least show evidences!! i know it get's tough to control a company when it's big, But Vistara isn't even this big with a fleet of 40! Look at your Low Cost Competitor SpiceJet! They deserve 5 stars because they have more than 110 Aircraft's and 680+ daily flights and still give personalized and award winning services! With such a rate i fear that Vistara might loose it's 5 star rating this year! Thanks for such a great start to the year Vistara!! And as a icing on the cake JUST LIKE JOSH CAHILL'S FLIGHT REVIEW WITH THIS FAKE 5 STAR AIRLINE I thought that the passenger's privacy might be an issue so I stayed back in the Aircraft since the end and after everyone deboarded I asked the crew once again if I could take some pictures and videos now, She told me to talk to her senior in a very rude and unprofessional manner with no luck I came back to get my stuff and deboard and the crew member then told me,""Are you done?!"" And the tone showed the fact that she didn't like working her job or with this Airline who was once a 5 star Airline likeliness to recommend 0 I'd rather give them a -10 stars if I had that option!!!!! And I know for a fact that Vistara doesn't pay attention to reviews either they just hire someone to copy and paste already written text by just replacing the surname time and again and the review is brushed beneath the carpet"
Thriveni Jay wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Port Blair - Chennai,Domestic,Economy,Ms.Thriveni,"Very poor ground staff. In particular one vistara check in person named Chandrakala is clueless about customer service. She took an instant dislike for me ( I don't know why) Lied about my baggage check in policy and ensured I carried 1bag as handbaggage. Although it could have been accomodated as check in.
What more, she was so rude in front of all other passengers and spoke in a loud uncivilized manner.
I would never recommend vistara to anyone nor use myself next. In fact, I may post my reviews on various social media platforms just so others do not experience this kind of humiliation."
Kciff wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Bagdogra - Dibrugarh,Domestic,Economy,"Pretty good with timing, checkin, luggage","I liked the way the airline took care of us from baggage scanning to ticketing. The service on the flight was very good, seat spacing was fine, and for a short flight, they were giving everyone water and peanuts. The only thing I don't like and this applies to all the airlines in India is the copious use of plastic from the security ties on the bags to the drinks on the flight. When will airlines try to reduce plastics?"
BalkrishnaShroff wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Mumbai - Varanasi,Domestic,Premium Economy,An excellent experience !!,"We had a great experience flying with Vistara. The check-in was very quick and smooth. The boarding started exactly half an hour before flight. It was a pleasant surprise to be upgraded to premium economy. The cabin service was great and so was the quality of food. The in-flight entertainment was very easy to navigate. The flight landed on time. On the whole great experience.
In future we are going to make Vistara our first preference airline in India."

The flights were on time and the staff kept us well informed and was always prompt and proper. Ready to help.
Good work."
