Himani wrote a review Jun 2018,40,New Delhi - Bagdogra,Domestic,Economy,The Star Airlines - Vistara,"It was a flight to remember. As per its new promotion line, I did have a new feeling, Infact a good feeling. Right from entering into the airport , the Vistara crew took us in hands. I was traveling with my family out of whom my Mom ( a senior citizen) and my son ( a five year old) ; both needed attention , but I didn’t have to worry much because of the promptness and hospitality of the staff.
They helped us in check in of the baggage, arranging a cart , sumptuous meals as per our choice .
Overall, a very pleasant flight. Not to forget, the flight which offers goo legroom space in Economy Class .
Thank you Vistara. Keep it up !!"

NiteLifeMedia wrote a review Jun 2018,30,Mumbai - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Thai Flight attendant with huge attitude,"I'm a regular with Vistara and prefer flying with them over other airlines due to their fabulous service and connectivity. However this time flying back from Mumbai i had the worst experience flying vistara.

There was a Thai Flight attendant who was extremely rude and curt in her responses to not only me but other passengers as well. I had to request to talk to the Flight Purser to get the situation resolved .

Another passenger was being loud and watching movies on his iPad without headphones and was not even wearing his seatbelt. Being disturbed by the loud noise i requested the flight attendant to move to another seat that was empty and was denied it saying someone else was coming to it. We were airborne and i asked how could someone board the plane if we are airborne. She just smiled and walked away. I again requested that she either address the noisy passenger or allow me to move to another seat. She told me that if i wanted to move to premium economy i could but i'd have to pay for the seat. The manner in which she said it was taunting and then said so you wanna pay or not. I requested to talk to the purser and got my seat changed to avoid any disturbance.

So since when does vistara not care for other passengers and show attitude like that thai flight attendant. Also how can Vistara even take off and violate FAA rules when a passenger is refusing to put on a seatbelt and playing movies without headphones. Shouldn't that passenger be deboarded ?"

Sourav Datta wrote a review Jun 2018,50,New Delhi - Kolkata,Domestic,Premium Economy,Backed by Tata and groomed by Singapore Airlines to excellence,"This was the best flight of my life till date. Separate check in counters and boarding lanes for Business, Premium Economy and Economy. Ground services were just awesome. Cabin crew members were well behaved, professional, helpful and courteous. All three cabins are separated by curtains and all cabins have different colors of lights which acts as mood changers. I suggest, travel Premium Economy which offers unmatched benefits and also the cost is little more than Economy. Foods were served for free accompanied by one soft drink and Starbucks coffee. Choice of meals were also there. At Kolkata, luggage was delivered on priority since I travelled Premium Economy. Only disadvantage is that, they do not offer On board entertainment but that too will be shortly implemented, after all they are the youngest in Indian aviation. Fly with Vistara at least once and then you will understand the difference with other carriers."

Booking- Now I started looking for tickets on different websites. At first I saw at Vistara official website but it was showing too costly than the other airline ticket booking sites. Firstly I visited Cleartrip there was no offer. Then I visited MakeMyTrip I got an offer paying via PayPal I would get discount of Rs.800 + ICICI bank debit/ credit card cash back offers. Then I quickly booked proceeded with the booking on MMT. And they emailed me the tickets within few minutes.Overall it takes less than 10 minutes and the process is really smooth.

Vistara Business Class – Ground Experience:

#1. Dedicated CheckIn

I arrived at the Chennai airport 3 hours prior to departure , which I generally do. I spend time trying Lounges facilities and roam around the airport. The checkin started for the Vistara flight MAA-CUU. I approached to the counter , there was separate counter for the Vistara Club Members . So the checkin process was done quickly and I got the boarding pass within minutes.

#2 . Security – No Fast track lane:

After getting the boarding pass I quickly approached towards security hold , done with my security checks and then had some soft drinks from self service counter( where you put the money in machine mention which drinks you want, it automatically comes) . In the meanwhile I got message on my phone from vistara that flight has been delayed . The actual departure time of flight was 5:50pm but it was late and it departed at 6:30pm. The flight"

I have now used Vistara several times and each time they have been excellent. On time, clean and modern fleet, good service from check in to crew and options of business, premium economy and economy ticket prices.

I have used both business and premium economy and recommend the premium economy for combination of quality and value.

I suppose when you bring companies like Singapore Airlines and Tata together the chances of success are always higher"

The legroom and seat pitch were great.
No screens for entertainment are available on vistara aircrafts and i personally don't have an issue with it.
The food served was amazing in taste as well as presentation.
The only two things I found odd were that at the airport gate no special seating area is available for business class or Vistara Club members. The limited seating is full very fast and we have to stand there for atleast 20mins which is not so good if you are paying for business or premium economy.
The second thing odd was that no dessert was served on board even when it was on the menu. Other than that i feel vistara business class is the way to fly."

Each and every time she gets equal love, care and affection from the Cabin crews. But this time the team was exceptionally good. We always in hurry passengers generally loose our patience when a flight landed to our destination. Whatever the rules and safety are we act like educated illiterate and prefer to get up from the seat, take out our handbags and make a queue to get out of the plane. This time also witnessed the same. But the way cabin crew handled the passenger with poise and dedication was very impressive.
Hope to fly together soon."

Arrived in T3 terminal through Air Arabia from Sharjah and breezed in to the Domestic Terminal.
The check was Super Fast and my luggage tagged to priority. The boarding pass invited us to the lounge near Gate No 41. At the Vistara Lounge the reception was Top Class with Professional / Service oriented staff ( The spoon and fork were delivered to my table with a bow). The spread was heart warming .. Hot Conjeevaram Idlis served with 3 types of chutney, Sambar and Idli podi. The buffet also featured tasty Upma, parantha with aloo, scrambled eggs, fruit platter, corn flakes and a host of pastries ( brownie was mouth watering). Ambience was quite good with all type of seating to choose from.
Departure was announced and the boarding was efficient. Yashika, Anshika and the Hostess team received every one with a warm greeting, regardless of the class of travel.
Yashika was quick to notice the weary traveller in me and hence did not waste any time to support me with a cup of water and cold towel.
Due to the overnight travel was not interested in the breakfast offering and was inclined to doze off.. But a cursory look at the menu card tempted me to request a breakfast.. and I did make a good decision. Fruit platter included Kiwi, the paneer was nicely diced and served (not the standard cubes) along with the paranthas. Curd went off smoothly and was offered bread and croissants. Surprise addition was Starbucks coffee made from Coorg Arabica beans ( but the temperature was lukewarm).
Then I started to browse the newspapers ( as I had to update myself for my next 10 day stay in India).
Yashika offered my periodicals also and hence my day was made!!!
Himanshu piloted the A320 Neo among the clouds during descent ably and we had a safe landing on time.
Had a rewarding experience during my Maiden Flight in Vistara.. Young and Dynamic team will take Vistara to New Heights!!!!

The fod being served on all flights is so freaking expensive that when it comes (being added in your bill doesnot directly impact you) seems like it is coming free of cost, it really adds a silver lining. But twice in a row i was disappointed to be served vegetarian food inspite of having mentioned non veg at the time of booking my tickets. So that was kind of stressful for a hard core non vegetarian like me. The first time they claimed that they had run out of non veg and on the same return journey, they claimed that there was an error and against my name they couldnot find non veg. My bad luck but might help future passengers in future to take a printed proof at the time of booking.
Also, for Vistara, i would like to suggest that you should have options. The boring paneer gravy or chicken gravy along with dal is a done-to-death option in the menu card"
