Apurva S wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Lucknow - Mumbai,Domestic,Premium Economy,Customer friendly,"This is my second travel with vistara airline and most memorable. I was traveling from lucknow to mumbai via delhi with inter connecting fight with vistara. The day i was traveling is women's day i didn't know that until i reach the ticket counter. They wish and greet me with the rose and upgrade my ticket to premium economy class because they ar celebrating women's day. Such a lovely gesture right!. I was came with big luggage as i came home from dubai and travel back there after mumbai visit. The ground staff was very very helpful with my extra language. They are very polite and helpful in every possible thing as i am solo traveller. Very comfortable flight, Refreshment was good, customer friendly staff. I recommend to everyone one to give a chance to this flight service, as they never disappoint you."
Fouad Farooq wrote a review Jun 2018,50,New Delhi - Bengaluru,Domestic,Economy,Vistara amazes me more than the previous experience each time I board it,I boarded a flight from Delhi to Bangalore. It was an evening flight. The flight was amazing and so was the food. But the best of all was the customer service by the cabin crew in the plane. I was sitting beside an old couple and there was a woman with an infant. How the crew handled them and helped them repeatedly and their attention to them will never be forgotten by me. Its my preferred airline for sure.
Rahul M wrote a review Jun 2018,50,New Delhi - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Air Vistara Service,"THe recently started Tata and Singapore Aire tie up airline service is a treat for travellers.
The aircraft was well maintained, staff extremely courteous and friendly.
The airline was extremely accomdative and different from the other airline services cirrently operating on the domestic sector
There was inflight snack / meal service which was quite unlike the meals offered by Jet or Air India.
To top it all, Vistara served a delicious and nutritious well thought hot meal serving decent portions Chicken kebabs, a nutritious chocolate bar and other accompaniments.
All in all a very impressive and impressionable service in recent years.
Completely bowled over and plan to take Vistara for all future journeys

pdswalia wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Mumbai - New Delhi,Domestic,Business Class,Nice flight,"Have been flying Vistara for some time now. Was a big fan of Indigo but switched to Vistara and have been quite happy on my decision. Everything about Vistara is good - booking to check-in, in-flight service, the crew etc. Most of the the flights have reached the destination before time. In-flight food is average. Seats are comfortable."

Himani wrote a review Jun 2018,40,New Delhi - Bagdogra,Domestic,Economy,The Star Airlines - Vistara,"It was a flight to remember. As per its new promotion line, I did have a new feeling, Infact a good feeling. Right from entering into the airport , the Vistara crew took us in hands. I was traveling with my family out of whom my Mom ( a senior citizen) and my son ( a five year old) ; both needed attention , but I didnâ€™t have to worry much because of the promptness and hospitality of the staff.
They helped us in check in of the baggage, arranging a cart , sumptuous meals as per our choice .
Overall, a very pleasant flight. Not to forget, the flight which offers goo legroom space in Economy Class .
Thank you Vistara. Keep it up !!"
