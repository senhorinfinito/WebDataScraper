Ekin T wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Singapore - Mumbai,Asia,Premium Economy,Excels at Service!,"It was our first flight on this, now 5 year old, airline, seemingly a mash up of SQ know how and Tata money and connections.

Premium Economy on this route is nothing to write home about. Slightly more legroom and recline than the Evonomy offering, and the food comes slightly better presented. Otherwise, seemingly it is the same food choice/offering as the Econ.

However, the onflight crew were excellent! Attentive and genuinely caring. Very well done!

At a time when even SQ’s inflight teams are increasingly moving towards becoming automatons, the Vistara crew provide a breath of fresh air!"

Vistara was not ready for compensate and not help to book other flights. I spend 15 hrs in the airport, waste my time and money. They are not bothered about anything.

After a smooth check in and boarding experience we came to know that seats assigned were non reclining :( We were not aware of the fact and that came as a bit of shock for 6 hours flight. Cabin crew did take a notice and helped us to shift to better seats. Flight meal menu was fairly good with prompt service of airline stewardess."

Gaiabeliever wrote a review Jan 2020,50,New Delhi - Bangkok,Southeast Asia,Economy,"So far, two different flights and all I have is good to say","Have flown Vistara twice now, both times were excellent experiences. No problem with baggage, dead-on, on-time flight, courteous service, overall, worth paying the extra for. In fact, MORE than worth paying the extra that they want for a flight considering the pain in the a** that the other airlines can be and are much of the time; lost baggage, stolen/opened baggage, delayed flights (missed connecting flights), rude service people, you name it, I've had it with the others. Not with Vistara, so far, only positives with this airline and hope they keep the business model they have now. One note, I'd left my phone on a pathetically slow charging station, went through the gate, down the loading ramp to the plane, then realized I'd left it. Running back up the ramp in a panic, the security people refused to let me out, but relayed to the Vistara counter people what the panic was, one of their counter people ran to the charging station and started lifting phones until I waved madly through the glass that it was mine. When he brought it to me, he insisted that he see me unlock the security on it before he would let me go with it (exactly as he should have done!), I did and all were happy. The guy went above and beyond and I totally owe that dude a drink sometime! Whew!"

Ravish B wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Hyderabad - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,HOW VISTARA HELPED MY GIRLS TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT…,"As a father of twin girls who are 10 year old, I want them to be independent and as an initial step towards that, I decided to send them to my sister’s place in Mumbai. I gave call to my cousin in Mumbai that I am planning to send girls alone via flight to Mumbai and about to book a flight either in Indigo or Spice jet. He recommended booking in Vistara as they are rated number one and girls would have a wonderful experience. Well going by the strong recommendation I decided to go ahead booking with Vistara and let my girls get pampered.

At the booking site, I couldn’t find an option of booking unaccompanied minor. I called their customer support for assistance and I was completely surprised by the solution I received. “Sir, there is no fare difference between the Child and Adult. So you can book in the adult and fill the form of unaccompanied minor and send them across by paying the fee of 2500 each.” I did not want to take a chance on this, but I dint want my girls to miss the premium experience of Vistara which was recommended by my cousin. So, I decided to reach out Vistara on twitter on 4th Jan 2020 where they replied me with the link to book the tickets with their young stars program. Again an Adult was mandatory and reached out to Vistara again on twitter and they arranged a call back to assist me in booking and the tickets were finally booked! But I wasn’t able to pay the unaccompanied fee due to reasons best known to them. I was pretty excited for my girls to experience the hospitality of Vistara.

The flight was on 11th Jan 2020 at 8:20 AM and we reached at HYD airport counter at 6 AM. At the counter the entire staff was clueless not only on they have unaccompanied minor scheduled to travel but also on the procedure. It took 40 mins for them to generate the boarding pass though all the forms in quadruplicate were made available to them along with tickets and id. Till then we all were standing in front of their counter. They took girls inside and asked us to come back again at 8:30 AM to take the form as they do not give the form now incase if the flight gets cancelled. I reached there at 8:30 but received the form at 8:50, as the staff was clueless again on procedure. I requested at the counter that I wish to make the fee payment of unaccompanied minor from BOM – HYD as suggested on twitter that both the payments can be made over airport counter. They were clueless and suggested that I make the payment either at BOM or over online thru customer care support.

Girls landed at BOM and were handed over to my cousin who was there to receive at the airport around 10:45. I was shocked that my girls were not offered a meal and one of my girl asked if they had to purchase the meal. I immediately called the customer care and enquired if my girls were entitled to get complementary meals on board to which they said yes and said they would enquire on what went wrong. I did not want to be prejudice till I get to know where the things went wrong. So, as suggested at airport to get the payment online for the unaccompanied minor from BOM –HYD, I requested if they could assist me with the same. The executive denied. I insisted please give me the same in writing or raise a complaint and share me the reference. He said he cannot do this even and I requested to transfer the call to the manager as I wanted to resolve this issue. The manager said that I need to write an email for the same then I asked them the basic question of having this customer care number. Since I was not satisfied the response and I had other priorities to attend, I asked for my reference I would like to record this call and asked the permission if I could. The manner I got the response post recording was completely different and positive. The complaint was also lodged and also got assurance of assisting me to make the payment.

I kept on following up on twitter for making the payment and at least make sure that the experience for my girls on the onward journey from BOM – HYD is pleasant and memorable.

On 13th Jan, I gave a final attempt to make the payment from my end for unaccompanied minor and reached Vistara thru twitter. This was basically for 2 reasons. 1) I did not want my sister to pay for this and 2) I wanted to make sure that the airport staff is aware that unaccompanied minors are travelling with them. I got a call from Vistara at 11:23 PM asking me on what assistance is required and I asked them to give me a call any time from 9 AM next day as I was already asleep. Nothing happens till 4:15 PM and I get a call from Vistara stating sorry Sir, we were unable to assist you to make the payment and the payment is done at the airport. I assumed my sister might have made the payment as they had reached the airport by that time.
I get a call from my sister at 5:48 PM saying that they have taken girls inside and informed me that they are staying though they have been asked to leave. I enquired if they got a copy of form they submitted and payment acknowledgement which she denied and said that they said the payment has already been received. We both were confused as neither of us had made the payment. I asked her to stay at the airport till you get the form signed which you submitted.

I reached out to Vistara on twitter to contact me immediately. I got a call and explained them that neither of us have made payment and no acknowledgement of girls been given while they are taken inside. At 6:03 PM I get a call from my sister that now that are asking for payment and she is able to see the girls standing in the airport all alone! My sister again calls me at 7:20 PM that she finally received the acknowledgement and the girls have boarded the flight and she insisted to raise a complaint as the entire process is in mess.

Girls arrived safely at Hyd. And I enquired on what all they did in BOM and airport. Here is their experience with Vistara!

“While going to Mumbai, the support staff was really good and friendly. We were the last one to board the flight and since we were given out seats in the 3rd last row of the flight we fell asleep, probably that’s why we were not served the food. We were pretty hungry as we were last to get down from the flight and it was a pretty long morning for us. While come back to Hyderbad, it was good that we were early to airport. We were taken inside by an uncle who just kept on telling us 2 mins and all of a sudden he vanished and one aunty came and took us for check in. During check in she asked if the payment is done and we were clueless as we are not aware of this. Then she called Fui (Aunt) to make the payment then the aunty made us go thru all the process and this time we got seats in front and were among the 1st to get meals. The meals were not so great it was like puff, so I just ate the outer layer and asked for coffee since we were hungry, but coffee was black so dint like the taste and then we opened the boxes we got to eat. Upon arrival we had to take the bags ourselves from the belt but in Mumbai one uncle helped us with baggage.”

To Sum up:
Vistara doesn’t care for kids/minors as they are not decision makers in choosing the airline. They are pathetic in handling kids and providing them with wow experience. Kids/Minors are least priority for them. I should have understood this while booking the tickets as they do not support unaccompanied minors as other airline do on their website. I paid more than 50% of the entire ticket cost to Vistara for this experience apart from 20% premium for choosing them over other airlines. But I thank Vistara for what all has happened, from parents point of view this turned my little girls in to young matured girls who can now control their feelings when things are not going the way they expected. They can resist hunger and stand tall all alone in patience in an unfamiliar location waiting for things to fall in place without panicking!

Thank you Vistara, this would not have possible if you had proper system and SOP’s in place."
Sam M wrote a review Jan 2020,50,New Delhi - Amritsar,Domestic,Economy,Good value and good service,"We checked in to the Vistara desk at New Delhi after a flight from London. We then went to security and I mistakenly left my duty free in my hand baggage so I was turned back at securtiy with the very friendly advice from the security agent to go back to Vistara and that they would sort me out. This I did and the check in agent very kindly and efficiently booked my hand luggage onto the flight. She would even have retrieved my main case and allowed me to pack the duty free in it but luckly enough we able to sort the problem with the hand baggage.
The onward flight to Amritsar was excellent both in terms of food and service.
Ten out of Ten for Vistara."

ssbhat2018 wrote a review Jan 2020,30,Mumbai - Singapore,Southeast Asia,Economy,"Being Singapore Airlines connected, expected much better, sadly a let down","High expectation were met with downright average service and less than average food. UK105 had a very hard working Air Hostess, called Roxanne. She was the brightest spot in the travel. Took care of more than a share of her workload and was very polite, cheerful and helpful. She was also called upon when there was an emergency on board, when a elderly gentleman blacked out, when going to the toilet.
UK106. The food was not bad in taste but in variety and preparation. How can you have 2 choices of vegetable slurry (dal makhani & corn spinach) sandwiching rice. There was too much of the vegetables to finish. The plastic cutlery served had plastic wrapping which took time to tear off. Why of why, cant a notch be given to make it convenient ? No fruits. While I had dozed off when the dessert was served, I had to request the air hostess to give me the same. Overall, the food choice, selection was lower than a budget airline.
While this may sound a bit outrageous, I cannot but comment on it. The air hostess dresses or uniforms looked as if they were 1 or 2 sizes larger than needed. The styling was also one of the worst amongst Asian Airlines.
Attitude of the air hostesses were also a bit aloof and requests were met with frosty serving. Certainly not Singapore Airlines genes.
Safey checks were cursory, not pointed and efficient.

We had flown all over India with the same bags and had zero issues with other airlines. After a bunch of complaining we ended up paying 2500 rupees ($35 USD) extra to check a carry-on bag because he said “it definitely will not fit in the cabin” — sure enough it was a brand new plane with TONS of extra cabin space. The bag would have easily fit.

On this experience alone we will never fly Vistara again."
