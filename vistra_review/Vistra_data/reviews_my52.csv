Haridaskp wrote a review Jan 2020,40,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),Domestic,Economy,The stamp of Tata & it's class is evident.,The ambience and class is there for all to see despite it not being in the top league but still there is a royalty to it which shows without being told. The staff well motivated and well mannered working in tandem with a vision. You get the feel of an airline that's professional and wishes to reach places. Wishing them all success.
