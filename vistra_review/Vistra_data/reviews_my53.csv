Vedang1990 wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Mumbai - Singapore,Southeast Asia,Economy,Nice experience,Tried Vistara for the first time Mumbai - SG flight. Had high expectations as they are partners with SIA and wasn’t disappointed for the service provided for the given fare. Departure and landing was on-time. Web checkin was smooth. Leg rooms were ok but they had premium economy seats which have better leg rooms (maybe next time). In flight entertainment is available but you need your own smart device to connect and watch. Food was decent as well (cheaper boxes and cutlery). Blanket was provided as well. Overall it seemed like a nice cheaper substitute for SIA. Will always choose Vistara over Indigo/Air-India henceforth.
Parmjit2006 wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Goa - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Horrible Horrible time taken for baggage delivery,We boarded UK842 from Goa to Mumbai. The chick in was fantastic. Unlike Mumbai where you find porters just loitering around the porters at Goa helped us at every step. Flight and food was ok. BUT when we landed at Mumbai it took one hour forty minutes for luggage to arrive that is double the time of entire flight. There was no staff around. After half an hour a young guy comes but has no clue what to do. After another half hour a senior comes but just stands there with no action. Guests were frustrated. An elderly gentleman was tearing his hair off as he had another flight to catch. I even asked if we can go and they will send the luggage but no response. Shame on the airline and I hope the airline will take the manager of Mumbai airport to task. As I had written in my earlier review the porters at the check in just stand around and do not help with luggage. In contrast the Goa airport was fantastic.

The best thing was the duty staff was very simple and proactive ,eye contact was special.No other airline crew i have seen daring to have eye contact.
service has been polite and decnt.
Announcements were so clear first time I could remember all four Hostesses
Ishita,Ishika,Pooja and Rashmi

All were excellent
Sears comfortable and no bad odour
Congrats to Management
BEST PILOTS"
juzarz2019 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Mumbai - Hyderabad,Domestic,Economy,Flight on time. I was upgraded to premium economy (frequent flier base),"I was upgraded to premium economy but It was disappointing that the air hostess denied me free meal service, as given to premium economy passengers, stating that I was upgraded from economy (frequent flier base). Earlier during Jet Airways I was up graded to business class several times being a frequent flier silver, but I was always served free business class meals."
NDA wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Bagdogra - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Ripoff Airlines,"This airlines does not care about its passengers. It will rip you off with premium prices and substandard service.

Flying out of Bagdogra it is the only flight which is over 6 hours late. Other airlines, including IndiGo, Air Asia, GoAir flights to Delhi had far less delays.

The ground staff were unhelpful. Information was not updated or sent on time. It did not matter whether one had a connecting flight or not.

It is very poor service."
Esbe2013 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Kolkata - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Perfecr,"Everything went absolutely fine, except a small issue because we added Priority boarding and luggage later. However, that was more or less sorted out.
The food was excellent, the flight smooth and timely.
Thanks!"
Lopa Bhatt wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Mumbai - Colombo,Asia,Economy,Cut above the rest,Everything from booking to flight interior to service to airport check-in to baggage handling is better than most Indian airlines. They charge a small premium but for discerning customers this may not be an issue
Rashmi Raman wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Amritsar - Chennai,Domestic,Economy,Flying back from Amritsar to Chennai,"We flew vistara all the way from Amritsar to Chennai with a flight change in New Delhi.
The aircraft is well maintained, the cabin crew are very efficient, they serve u either a snack or a hot meal depending on the time of flight . The hot meal we were served was hot and delicious.
They have onboard entertainment thro wifi and one didn’t even feel the time go by.
The airline kept to its time schedules
Only Vistara for me."
Mihir wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Dubai - Mumbai,International,Economy,UK202- Valued for money for a full service,"Air Vistara is a good option to and from Dubai!

The flight was on time , service and crew were very good and well trained. Good and probably the only option for a full service airline.

Price was also as low as low cost so worth it."
