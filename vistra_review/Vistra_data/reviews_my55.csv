2travelight wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Udaipur - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Rip Off Airline,"Long chaotic lines at check-in where employees target tourists especially with high baggage fees for extra weight. When you fly into India on an International Airline, the baggage weight allowance is way higher than what Vistara allows and they know it! They make tons of money this way, so don't be fooled by any low fares - you'll pay for it in the end, and MORE!!"
Ajay Kacker wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Mumbai - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Decent flight... though delayed during take off,"Flew on the 5:20 pm flight from Mumbai.

Boarding was on time but take off took around 45 to 50 minutes post door closing.

Snacks served were nice and hot. Had the chicken tikka and calzone.

Service was good

Seating was decent"
Raja R wrote a review Dec 2019,30,New Delhi - Amritsar,Domestic,Economy,OK flight,"My wife & I flew Delhi-Amritsar on Vistara’s economy class. Check-in was smooth. Boarding was confusing - there were supposedly three queue’s for boarding - business class; back rows; and front rows. We were in the second segment and were waiting for announcement of our turn to board. In reality there was no such process and everybody boarded at their convenience - this was strange.

As I passed premium economy seats to head to my seat in Economy, I felt that there was very little difference between this and the economy class. The combination of leg room and seat design is such that I couldn’t hold the magazine at a convenient angle & distance so as to be able to read - and this is when the person ahead of me had not reclined his/her seat. This is a real issue. To my good fortune, the seat next to me was empty and so I turned sideways and was able to read the magazine. We were served sandwiches and it wasn’t good. I might consider Vistara for business class seats but would prefer Indigo for Economy flight"
elisabetta m wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Bengaluru - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Don’t fly Vistara,"In summary, our experience was one of no service, absolute lack of transparency and respect for passengers, and in fact deliberately misleading behavior. My family and I were booked on the 5:40 pm flight from Bangalore to Delhi. 20 minutes before the scheduled arrival, the captain informed passengers that - due to fog in Delhi- we would be rerouted to Ahmedabad. After waiting for couple of hours on the plane on the tarmac, without any further information on next steps, we were deplaned. Staff on board - from the captain to the crew- were not able to give us any information. There was no Vistara ground staff to receive us and we were left to wander in the airport not knowing what to do - whether our luggage would be taken off the plane, whether we would be put on another flight...complete uncertainty! In the end, after finding some ground staff by chance, we were told our checked in luggage would be kept on board and given a new boarding pass with a departure of 3:00 am - no gate. We were basically given no choice and kept hostage in the airport - no offer to put us up in an hotel or otherwise make up for the considerable inconvenience. Again, 3 am passed and no information whatsoever from Vistara. We had to go around the airport and find the manager, and after much pressure from irate passengers, he reluctantly disclosed that the new pilot would only arrive in Ahmedabad around 4:30 am and the flight to Delhi would only depart after that - maybe. Vistara staff must clearly have known this all along and lied to us. This behavior is unacceptable and substandard - Vistara showed complete disregard of our rights as passengers. I can understand that weather conditions are beyond the airline’s control, but mitigating the impact on passengers with appropriate standards of service, consistent communication and transparency is not. Vistara failed! I will not fly this airline again and nor should you!"

Everything for them is MINOR WEAR AND TEAR no matter how destroyed things are!!!
Copy pasting reply about about stains. I have not reported stains.
The suitcase DID HAVE A WHEELS COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF!!!
That is a major distinction and makes the suitcase completely UNUSABLE!

Terrible service from ground to customer service online!!!
Completely unacceptable especially since I paid extra to have additional baggage services included.

Avoid this airline and better get the cheapest there is because you will not be getting anything better! Even the best is obviously very poor! Complete unwillingness and rip off!!!"
MG123 wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Chandigarh - Udaipur,Domestic,Economy,Terrible customer service,Vistara delayed our flight without warning due to a change in winter scheduling (not sure how they didn't anticipate this until the morning of our flight?!) This meant we could not make our connecting flight (also Vistara - booked as a single trip). We were offered no apology and no attempt was made to rectify the situation. It took several frustrating calls to customer service to get us onto a later flight only to discover on our way to the airport that our tickets had been cancelled. The call centre personnel were difficult to communicate with and rude. Luckily staff at the airport were able to get us onto a flight but overall a very stressful and unpleasant experience.

vinittaneja wrote a review Dec 2019,30,New Delhi - Goa,Domestic,Economy,Step motherly on food,"My daughter and I flew Air Vistara Delhi to Goa on 4th December 7.15 pm flight.

First and foremost, the flight was delayed by more than an hour.

The sad part was that, if you book their regular fare through e travel companies like make my trip, they seriously reduce the options of food you can consume in the aircraft even though they have other options available in flight.

So our options were really reduced to half cooked meals like rajma chawal, poha, upma etc (not even sandwiches) where you put hot water to cook and leave it for 5 odd minutes.

By the time our turn came, even the most popular rajma chawal had got over.

We finally hit the airport by 11.15 pm, feeling hungry and angry.

Found this approach of Vistara very discriminating."

But since the exit of of Jet Airways the in flight service of Vistara is on slump.
On 15/12/2019 I travelled from Bagdogra to Delhi. First of all they were not having enough Non Veg meals the Flight Stewards were almost begging passengers to accept Veg meals. Then just see the quantity of tea being served it seems there was shortage of water or tea bags on the flight."

Without trying to resolve the issue, they are cancelling our tickets. All appeals to the chairman and CEO via email have been unanswered. This is by far the worst customer service.

Flight crew was very courteous. Flight was delayed due to bad weather but that’s no one’s fault. They served a cold sandwich on the 1 hr flight. All good until now. The sandwich gave me severe food poisoning which meant our sight seeing trip to Amritsar was spoiled to a huge extent. On our return, we were told the luggage had to be weighed and the personal item could only a laptop and nothing else. We were not asked to weigh on our flight from Delhi. We checked in our luggage and then saw multiple people brining in oversized and heavy carry-on baggage. One person had 6 “personal item” bags. The flight was delayed for no reason. It took over 45 min to get the suitcases. One hour flight and one hour for luggage.

argnihd wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Chandigarh - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Rescheduled the flight and very poor customer service,"The flight got rescheduled all of a sudden. The new flight was way expensive than this one. I asked customer care agent to compensate or book that flight for me as it is not my fault that their flight got rescheduled suddenly 2 days before the schedule time.

I wasted over 3.5 hours on the phone with helpline but still they're not able to resolve the problem. The customer care staff has been rude over the phone. The harassment I have gone through cannot be put into words. I just wanted them to compensate for their 'mistake' as its not my fault that the flight got delayed. If not at least talk nicely.

This is not the type of service that is expected from such a reputable company. They disconnected my phone again and again. If they're not able to resolve the problem, at least answer the phone, apologise for the inconvenience you've caused me. This sector of your airline needs a huge improvement.

This was the first time i was going to experience Vistara and it has undoubtedly been the worst for me. Better go for Air India or any other reputable company.
