333zaink wrote a review Jul 2019,50,New Delhi - Bhubaneswar,Domestic,Premium Economy,Vistara - the answer to the airline industry in india.,"When this airline came about, it was much touted a a ""fine"" airline. I didn't believe it, and flew it - a few times, and heres the facts.

The simplest to interact with airline
The ease of being taken care of by non-overworked, happy, and genuine - not programmed, staff.

Each flight on vistara has been the most relaxing flight I've taken. Its not over done, its not treated like a cheap budget airline for low worth humans.
It genuinely does it well... And makes u feel... Relaxed.

It is, undoubtedly, the airline equivalent of sitting in a non fancy chair in a taj property, with the efficiency whiff of a vivanta... And fairly, paying the price of a Starbucks.

And none judges you for it. Not once in their hands.

Its every flight i book now.

Congratulations Vistara, you redefined the bar."

Felix A wrote a review Jul 2019,30,New Delhi - Amritsar,Domestic,Business Class,Business Class but service not at par,"We flew Business Class from New Delhi to Amritsar and back however, though the staff were polite and attentive, the service was way below par. The food on the way was not as per expectation in terms of taste or portion size, hardly any choices and served cold!

On the way back it was even worse with a simple tasteless sandwich that was served to all passengers across all class. This is not to say that we expected better food - we expected good food for all.

Also there is no in flight entertainment - at least business class could have had this provision.

However we would recommend use of their lounge at New Delhi airport - the spread of food is good though space is not well designed and would not be enough for a lot of guests."

Right from the arrangement of wheel chair to food were so efficiently and sympathetically worked out by the cabin crew(s), that I really felt overwhelmed. The premium Economy has extra leg space and a special Menu for the passengers. Apart from that overall I loved the way Vistara staff conduct themselves. I will always recommend travel by Vistara.

We as a group of 10 members had been to Andamans for Family Vacation. Just on seeing the flight details only I chose Vistara for convenience of timings. I was bit hesitant too. But it was really a great trip and all our kids enjoyed. Seating was very much comfortable and must to be appreciated. Snackers along with fair was very worthy. Attitude of Staff need to be applauded. Few could speak Tamil also and hence our aged parents were happy to converse with them. Wheel Chair assistance was provided without any hassle. I expect that the Air Vistara management shall upkeep their service quality constantly and improvise with many more amenities to establish it as one of the most preferred airlines in India.
Leena wrote a review Jul 2019,40,New Delhi - Chennai,Domestic,Economy,Good experience,"On paper, Vistara is a bit on the higher side as compared to Indigo and Spice Jet. However, as it does not charge extra for Web check-in, seat selection and meals, the overall cost was at par at least for this particular flight. The meal included was nutritious and tasty. Overall experience quite good. Only problem is that they fly to limited destinations as of now compared to other domestic airlines. For example, there is no flight from Delhi to Trivandrum though this is a busy route."

The aircrafts are clean and so are the washrooms. The schedules are convenient and keeping to time percentage high.
The announcements are clear and the flights especially take-offs and landings superb. It seems that the pilots enjoy flying and are not pushed so no rush or hustle bustle.
The food on board is rudimentary and not great. Perhaps the food that is sold is better.

We landed well in time and the in-flight service couldn't get better. Though, while booking the tickets, it didn't show us an option to buy a meal. I'd recommend checking with the airline before booking - as we didn't come across any option to buy a meal after completing the ticket booking."

Ptat14 wrote a review Jul 2019,20,Bengaluru - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Time is money,"Vistara has started flights between Mumbai and Bangalore reducing the vacuum left by exit if jet airways. But due to the schedule, the aircraft operates between these two cities multiple times in the day. Any airline that operates to Mumbai is sure to get it's schedule thrown to the wind and if it flies multiple times in the day, the problem multiplies exponentially. So all evening flights on this sector are delayed Atleast by an hr. So doesn't matter to what service you offer, if your schedule is all over the place nothing helps. So vistara needs to improve its scheduling and try to keep time. Until then it's just not worth to travel in the second half of the day."

It provides great services at a good price point. Nothing beats their customer service. The awards they have won since their inception are a testimony to that. I wish it continues so.

Though I feel, they need to improve their inflight entertainment. It has very less content to choose from. At least a business class deserves screens for the inflight entertainment rather than a customer going on one's own device and draining the battery on board."

Rakesh Rawat wrote a review Jul 2019,10,Chennai - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Diverted flight!,"I had a return flight from Chennai to Mumbai by Air Vistara flight UK 824( hope I got the number correct)on 1st July 2019 which was late in Chennai itself. Once the flight was nearing Mumbai the pilot announced that runway one is closed and they are arranging alternate runway but nothing like this happened. After hovering for around 35 mins the pilot announced we are diverting to Hyderabad as landing in Mumbai is not possible due to weather conditions and a skid aircraft. All this is fine and understandable. Bad weather is not airlines fault. But after landing in Hyderabad we were in the aircraft for nearly an hour and then around 0330 hrs we were asked to deplane and just left . No one from Air Vistara on ground to assist us and tell us what next . After 30 mins one gentleman came and he found it very difficult to handle the queries of the flyers. Not his fault he was all alone and we soon discovered that there are quite a few Air Vistara flights which have been diverted and are parked. I had to wait all night and finally got a boarding pass for a flight at 1130 hrs which later took flight at 1300 hrs. Nothing was offered by the airline but some water and tetra pack juices. Once again I say bad weather is not airline fault but poor handling definitely is.
A lot is expected of Air Vistara but alas very poor recovery systems in place.
Hope they get it right ."

Stephen L wrote a review Jul 2019,30,Mumbai - New Delhi,Domestic,Business Class,Debateable is business class is worth it,"My first trip with Vistara, it won't be my last as on board service was very good, but I do question the value of business over Premium Economy on the service. You get more luggage and a wider seat, both useful, and the food is good. The inflight entertainment is the same as everyone else and the very grand lounge in Mumbai tells you ""one free beer only, the rest you buy"" with only soft drinks on board.

Where business class, or frequent flyer gold status, is needed is the airport as the check in was horrendous. It is disorganised and there was one guy on his own trying to keep the flow of customers going. This valiant man was trying to control a lot of people in long queues and they are not patient. In some cases unfairly so, but most were correct in worrying about missing their planes despite being at the airport in good time.

So maybe Business is worth it, as you can get through the madness of check in relatively unscathed. If not, make sure you arrive at least three hours early."

I had different options every time I flew with them. The premium economy has special curated menu for the passengers. They provide excellent onboard service.
The cabin is neat and clean with comfortable seats. They have taken very good measures not to make it too crowded. The premium economy seats are more comfortable and cozy. The passengers are given blankets as well like international flights.

Pratyush Praveen wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Bengaluru - Mumbai,Domestic,Economy,Vistara - With Taj and Singapore hospitality combined,"I believe that as of now, Vistara is the best airways in the Indian Airspace. The highlight is the hospitality of TATA and Singapore Airlines. From Check-In to Baggage collection, every step is methodical and well defined.

May be some passengers may get upset, but the airlines should not allow two hand bags. Despite best efforts by the airlines (they provide priority tag for quick baggage disposal on the belt), passengers insists on carrying bulky hand bags in the cabin.

Quality of the food is good.

The member ship program should have more options under points redemption, other than redeeming the points only for flight. If I am wrong, I need guidance..."

Manoj Kumar wrote a review Jun 2019,10,New Delhi - Kochi (Cochin),Domestic,Economy,Poor Service Airline that is spoiling the name of Singapore Airlines.,Poor service airline. Expects the travelers to compromise on its services but refuses to adjust a small bit for its customers. I had a terrible experience on my return flight i.e. COK to DEL and on my onward travel on 2nd June 2019 from Delhi to Cochin in flight number UK885 the airline could not give us non-veg meal as they were short of the same and we were left with no option.
Manoj Kumar wrote a review Jun 2019,10,Kochi (Cochin) - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Very Poor Service and Uncourteous Staff.,"The airport staff at Counter number 16 on 17th June, 2019 took almost 20 minutes to get the check-in formalities done and hand over the boarding pass. We were three travelers and had three kilograms extra in total which means just a kilogram extra per passenger. But the executive on the counter refused to accommodate and made us to pay the extra sum. I requested a couple of times but the executive was very adamant. This was strange as the the airline expects the customers to adjust on the poor service they are offering but could not adjust a kilogram of weight extra. During the boarding process at the boarding gate the airline had untrained staff who could not even make the boarding process smooth. We were made to stand outside the queue as some other seat numbers were boarding but when our boarding started they did not bother to inform us. During the flight the airline could not give us a pillow on request which I suppose is a basic thing. The landing was also terrible as it was cloudy outside but had never ever experienced such turbulence in my life."

We were flying back to Sydney on 9th June from Bangalore and were aware that we would require additional baggage allowance. We purchased the maximum allowed being 20kgs and paid for it. Our credit card was debited for the relevant amount and we used the Vistara website to pre-purchase. At the airport the airline staff said there was no payment on their records. We showed them the screenshot of the payment and our bank statement but to no avail. They passed on the failings of their faulty website to us and we had to pay again (at double the pre-purchase rates) and were told that if we missed the flight that would not be refundable either and we would have to pay again for the flights. We were shocked at being held hostage by the manager on duty. We had no choice but to pay again. We felt unheard, no care for our circumstances. It was all about the money - $300. We have always travelled Vistara when we fly within India but are probably will not anymore given our experience. We will be lodging a formal complain with Vistara as well to review their processes."

Aman K wrote a review Jun 2019,50,New Delhi - Mumbai,Domestic,Premium Economy,An oasis in the Indian skies!,"Domestic flying in India off late meant choosing between really poor full service carriers or Low cost carriers. Vistara truly is a breath air offering a full service proposition with the flexibility to tailor your flying experience like Low cost carriers. I upgraded to premium economy on option town for a mere 1500 rupees (20 dollars) and got priority check in, boarding and extra leg room. The check in and boarding process were an absolute Breeze and the aircraft was a sparkling A320neo. Seat comfort was fantastic with roomy seats and noticeably more leg room that was ample to work on your laptop and be able to exit your seat without having your seat mate get up. Inflight service was TOP notch for short haul with a meal that actually tasted like real food and a choice of beverages (something no full service carriers offer in India). The inflight service was friendly and efficient. The entire meal service was cleared within 30 minutes with the crew doing an extra drinks run. To TOP it all, we arrived 10 minutes early. Vistara offers streaming entertainment although the interface was a tad clunky and the content could have been curated better. Vistara would do well to offer inflight wifi. This was probably my only gripe (if I had to be picky). Overall, Vistara possibly delivers the best short haul experience globally. I would totally recommend buying the upgrade to premium economy as such a nominal cost as it makes it a truly hassle free experience. Let’s hope they can sustain the quality and not go the same way as Jet Airways."
Multiple_Sarcasms wrote a review Jun 2019,30,New Delhi - Chandigarh,Domestic,Economy,Underwhelming experience!,"I flew Delhi to chandigarh via G8 106 on 17th May, first time with vistara.

What an underwhelming experience!

My flight was supposed to take off 5.10 PM, there was some rain (ten minutes) and the flight got delayed by half an hour.

There was just 1 lady at Gate 48 to handle the people.

I'm sure it wasn't a sudden delay, even with the half hour delay someone senior should have been there to assist her.

Thankfully the crowd was decent, and calm. Irritated as I was but calm.

Then I got SMS it was delayed to 8 pm!

The delay could not be helped, not in hands of Vistara, if due to safety it's landed in Varanasi (If I believe the story we got) but there was no service recovery of anykind.

We just waited till 8 pm, finally took off at 9.10 Pm. (Again, lets say it's not Vistara at fault)

But the other flights of Vistara and other flights were on time, there was no delay or anything for others. I know this because I saw the status board at the airport.

Weird how the only flight to be delayed was this. Maybe because it's a small city not Mumbai, Calcutta.. Etc.

Anyway.. We landed I think around 950 or something around that.

This situation could have been handled better, but having more people speaking to the flyers... Giving some access to lounge.. Or something. And better grievance handling training for the staff.

My first and probably last flight with Vistara. Will stick with GoAir."

My baggage was there only. I was informed no problem give us your mobile number security will call you if they wish. You already declared so no need we will mention here. Just before 30 minutes prior to gate close, we receive a phone call and called to open the baggage. But airlines security denied to handover the power bank. They simply told, you want to catch flight or power bank. choose one option. I request them I informed at check in counter then why airline officer misguide me ? But no use. I was having plenty of time during check in, no rush, to remove power bank from checked in baggage.
It was first trip with vistara airlines and in future we never use again not because that we lost power bank because of their misguide and behavior. They are not cheap in price but cheap in customer relationship.
Also I tried to contact airlines through email but I didn't received any response. It shows how they are maintaining relationship with customers."

Most Domestic Airlines have a policy of 15 kg baggage allowance per pax
But Vistara is the only Domestic Airline having a one piece baggage policy which I realized on the Day of My check in at Amritsar Airport
We had a total of 5 bags weighing 60 ks but when we went to check in we were told that we could only check in 4 bags as per Airline Policy so we checked in 4 bags weighing a total of 45 kg and went for Security check were we were in for a shock as one bag which my younger daughter packed had a couple of Jam & Honey Bottles and we were told it could not be taken in as hand Luggage
The value of the jams & honey was not much but my younger daughter insisted on taking it
So I went back to the check in counter where I was told to pay aprox Rs 6000/- for a bag having stuff costing less than Rs 2500/-
The staff were very rude and non Cooperative and Insisted on the Amount being paid
As i had previously weighed my baggage I knew that my baggage which was checked in Earlier was less than 60 kg but still then the Airline Staff wanted to Fleece me and as I asked to speak the Station Manager who did not bother to come
Later one staff took me aside as It was Quiet commotion at the counter I then explained to him that as i was travelling with young children and as the children could not manage the weight per bag I had Distributed it so the children could manage handling their own bags
Vistara Being a Part Of the TATA group I expected some compassion from the staff taking example of the Legendery Mr Ratan Tata who is one of My Idols
but the staff simply refused to listen but later after a lot of arguments which were witnessed by a lot of passengers they took into consideration that my total baggage weight was less than 60 kg and made me pay a sum of Rs 500/- as handling fee for the extra bag which could be done earlier without all the Drama

I wasn’t keeping too well today. While boarding my flight I requested Shaheroz and Biswajit at the boarding gate (87B) if I can be allowed to board first as and when the boarding for Economy class is announced. They both surprised me by offering to allow me to board as and when Business Class passengers could board. I was amazed at their empathy and spontaneous service. They understood that I wasn’t feeling well and took care of my physical as well as well as emotional needs.

My inflight experience was equally good. IFE Manpreet took very good care of all travelers including me. She was very hospitable. Observing that I want having much to eat, she offered yogurt and tea for me.I sincerely appreciate her thoughts.

Team isn’t diligent,"#VistaraDelayedMyBaggageFor5DaysAndCounting #InternationalTravelersBewareOfVistara #NoAccountability #Unprofessional #NotDiligent I had an international flight from Hyderabad,India -Minneapolis, a connection with Vistara. My baggage got delayed for more than 5days now. When I call them about the same no one had any clue where my bags are at. They don’t seem to be very diligent about my issue. I had to bounce back and forth calling customer service and airport authorities. I’ve not received my bags yet.

Here is my full story 1: The flight from Hyd-Delhi got delayed, they’ve put me on different flight and was told by airport authority in Hyd that my baggage will be delayed by 2-4hours I agreed to it Since 2-4 hours wouldn’t have made much difference. Arrived in the states at Noon on June1st. I’ve given them 24hours head start hoping I’ll receive an email. On June2nd when I’ve not received any update I got worried and called Customer service, After a long hold once I got through, I was told that they have to contact the airport authorities of Hyd for any status and the counter was closed(I called during my working hours, with the time difference and all) I’ve asked them to keep me posted once they get a hold of them. 2: Waited another 24hours and yet again I got the same response. June3rd- This time the next day I’ve directly contacted Hyderabad airport authorities myself, they said they have already sent them to Delhi.

3: Since I don’t have Delhi teams number I called Customer service, they created a request/complaint regarding the same and I’ll be contacted with the updates.
4: I was being contacted by Vistara associate from Delhi team on June 4th he asked me to raise a claim report at my airport which I did on the very same day and gave him the details of the file number
5: June 5th I’ve called the same guy from Delhi team he said he have to talk to KLM to send my bags.June 6th I’ve called the same guy and he didn’t respond. So I had to call back customer service yet another time only to be told they haven’t escalated the issue since the last I called them was June3rd and couldn’t get a hold of airport authorities to give me anything.

The staff didn’t seem to be really diligent about what they were doing. They sounded like they are in it for just put in the hours and get it over with, no one was concerned unless I constantly stay in contact to get my stuff moving. After calling repeatedly and telling repeatedly that keep me posted, I’ve not received updates. Vistara will run out of business if this is the behavior. Of all the 4times that I’ve visited India never had to face an issue like this. Will never knowingly fly with Vistara. I really want to sue Vistara if I can, for putting me on this mental roller coaster ride and making me sleepless(with all the phone calls to make) and taking up so much time in resolving an issue."
