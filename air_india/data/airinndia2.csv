My wife had had to see a doctor earlier in our holiday due to the usual deli belly but felt she would be able to make the flight. Whilst we were waiting in T3 Delhi Airport to drop our bags the heat was such that my wife feinted in the queue. After a lot of shouting someone from Air India did bring a chair for her to sit down (the only positive). I asked if they could help me contact our emergency travel agent line at which point the guy from Air India walked off never to be seen again. I managed to contact my agent who booked us into an airport hotel so she could recover. My wife was still suffering badly and was partly slumped over our suitcases. It took over another hour to get so one in the airport to get me a wheelchair and assist me to get out if the terminal to the hotel. At no point did anyone from Delhi Airport or Air India look for a first aid person to help. All Air India did was keep pushing me off to other people. It was only after a long and heated talk to the information desk did someone get me some help. I am disgusted by this whole episode and will never be taking another trip to India after this. We had loved the place up until then but the lack of assistance to someone clearly suffering was unacceptable in this day & age

I recently flew with them ( Feb 2020 ) and sad to say their service has not improved. Flight was delayed for several hours going to india and coming back, plane was being cleaned whilst we were boarding. Shocking service, headphones were dirty and not working. None of the entertainment screens were working correctly, my seat was broken and kept moving around. I went with a party of 6 people, we paid over £770, i wasted my money, felt like we were travelling back in time.

Cabin screw were rude and uninterested about the complaints.

Next time i'll stick with BA or Virgin and pay the extra money. At least i know i'll be there on time and my concerns will be dealt with professionally."

On an earlier connected Air India flight, where the entertainment system was not broken, it was slow and not easy to navigate.
The food offered was unexciting; a breakfast sandwich comprised two thick slices of white bread with no discernible filling!
At least the relevant cabin crew member was charming; seemingly embarrassed about the state of the aircraft and her inability to make things better. She did provide copious cushions to help with the broken seat with springs sticking through. Not helped that the flight was delayed - not unusual with Air India I am told. I have flown to India three times in the last twelve months and also taken internal flights- all with other Airlines. This was the first time with Air India, an airline I will avoid in future if possible."

The plane outbound was filthy. The entertainment system didn't work properly, they had to keep resetting it.

The flight home was better as it was on a Dreamliner because the original plane was delayed! Thank god for that! At least it was a bit cleaner. When we went to sit down, one of our seats didn't have a seat pad on it. They had to go off and find a new one. She told us that something had been spilt on it but when we got the ""new"" one, it looked more soiled than that. We put one of the blankets on there to cover it.
There's so much more I could say, but I'm all out of energy for it. We will NEVER go with Air India again.

Rushed to security - another longer than necessary queue and wait - and then ran for the plane. We were the last people to board. Years ago I vowed never to travel with Air India again ( a cancelled flight after waiting in the plane on the runway for several hours) but now that Jet Airways has gone broke, Air India has a monopoly on the Mumbai to Bhuj route. To add insult to injury, we were shoved onto a subsidiary airline of Air India, a propeller driven small plane with no real customer service. Second rate quality but Air India charges premium prices for this route. Over A$1000 return for 2 people ! After spending 2 days in Bhuj, we heard of at least two other couples who has missed the early morning flight - which didn't surprise us. If Air India doesn't increase their number of desk staff at early morning check in, then their customers will have to endure the stress of continued bad customer service.

Business Class",Disappointed.,"In February 2020, I flew four domestic routes with AI (BOM-BBI, BBI-DEL, DEL-MAA, MAA-BOM) in business class. Overall, the punctuality, service and product were poor quality. First, all flights were delayed. Each delay was anywhere from 1 hour to 4 hours with no explanation or compensation. Worse of all, a 4 hour domestic delay meant that I would have arrived at my destination, had my meeting, had a meal and could have settled in. Instead I sat in an airport waiting and waiting. Second, the service is terrible. Business class passengers are treated no better than any other passenger. There is no premium service at check in, no better attention to details, no above and beyond service to premium passengers. The lounges are either non-existent or very basic. No amenities are provided. Arrival at the gate is chaos and again no acknowledge or assistance provided to premium passengers. The in-flight service was so basic (no better than economy), the food was identical to economy, and the seats were worn out and not always comfortable. There was no attention provided by crew to premium passengers . Once food was served (in economy trays and dishes) and cleaned up, crew were never around. Finally, while the bags were tagged as premium bags, the bags arrived at all airports long after many economy bags arrived (so why tag the bags if there is no attention to this detail?). Finally, the product - the hard and soft product of AI is very very poor.
It is no wonder the airline is hemorrhaging and losing passengers and support. Why would anyone fly AI when there are so many better airlines out there. Vistara for one!
My advice and lesson learned, don't fly AI."

On the flight from Singapore to Delhi, they offered complimentary beverages (including alcoholic beverages) to start with along with munchies. The portions were good and the selection was good too. It was a night flight so they included dinner which was fantastic. Rice with a paneer curry and a kheer for dessert. That was rounded off by a tea/coffee.

I had paid Rs. 1000 & pre-booked a seat on the first row of the Economy cabin & my e-boarding pass after online check in also showed the correct seat number. But after dropping off bag at the airport counter when they gave me a printed boarding pass my seat was changed without even informing me. I fought so much at the boarding gate but they refused to do anything & were least bothered.
After boarding we were made to sit in the aircraft for almost 1 hour but no information what was happening & why the delay..??
Even during flight, the cabin temperature was very cold but the captain did not change the temperature even though 3-4 requests were made. The purser then gave me blanket which was the only good experience in this flight.
Travelling on this flight was like a punishment & I was just waiting to reach my destination at the earliest.
The food served was average but the way inflight crew did the service was also brash as if they were forced to do so.

I literally got a hemmaroid from this flight because the seat was like sitting on a plastic chair. The food was fine from Colombo to New Dehli, however it was terrible from Dehli to Sydney. I was starving by the time I arrived in Sydney. Would never fly this airline again EVER."

The seats looked like they had cushion covers that hadn't been cleaned since the 90's? The head rests didn't have any covers and they looked dirty. I immediately became worried, we took a closer look and found wrappers in the seat back pockets, crumbs on the floor from the previous flight(s) and debris all around looking like there has been no attempt to clean the seating areas in a while. The table looked so dirty that we took the decision that it would be unsanitary to eat in the plane, therefore consumed nothing for 9 hours, as if the customer facing area is this bad, I couldn't begin to imagine the state of the non customer facing areas (kitchen).
We took our seats and as the doors closed the pilot announced that we were now delayed for departure by 90 minutes (all because they were tardy getting people onto the plane). During the delay there was no attempt to make us comfortable - no offer of water or any checks by the crew for that matter.
Time to take off (thank you Heathrow for finding us an earlier slot - hence the delay was only 50 minutes) as the plane left the tarmac, my wife who was sat in the window seat was soaked as water started dripping from the vents. I tried shielding her but I got the same (I sent this feedback to Air India and haven't had any response in 5 working days). The host told us there's nothing he could do about the water and that it was condensation as the heating was on in the plane and we should regard it as ""Holy Water"" - how ridiculous! 2 hours into the flight I got up to use the restroom, there was a wet floor to greet me and a wet seat (with a yellow liquid - you do the math) had I wanted to sit down. I asked the host if they had cleaned or checked the toilets and they advised it's not their job.
Luckily my tiredness had taken a hold and I slept a considerable amount of the journey. The second serving of food however woke me as the smell overpowered the cabin... FISH! On a plane in a confined space. I was left baffled. The positive I have to share is that I got to my destination!
For my return journey I was lucky (or not) to be sat on the exit aisle seat. Check In was another experience as the guys at the counter wanted me to pay them in cash only to let my bag through as it breached their 23kg per bag policy (total allowance of 46 kg is only allowed if split between 2, my total was 30kg so I was in breach - again ridiculous!). Departure was delayed by 105 minutes.
The seats were the same condition as the previous flight, the headrests did have covers however these were stained (filthy unwashed or unchanged!) The side pocket had a few wrappers. We were sat in eye shot of the lavatories and again these were not cleaned by the airline during the journey. The joke is that the hosts actually used the bins in the lavatories to dispose of drink cartons and glasses. There was water on the floor outside the lavatory - a trip hazard and smell, and someone thought it would be best to just put some hand towels down on it, which were kicked off into the lavatory later. I refused to eat or drink as I knew the table wasn't sanitised and I would have hated to have to visited the lavatory.
So even if it is a longer journey to change somewhere else, take that option! Saving time was my priority however flying with Air India is not ever going to be an option again."

My friend has a severe nut allergy which she informed the airline prior to travel adn also when we boarded... There response 'you and your friends need to get off you cannot travel'. She eventually had to play down her allergy In order to stay on the plane and spent the flight in the toilet wearing a mask so as not to inhale the copious amounts of peanuts that were given out to other passengers. There were also Other passengers with the same allergy but the staff did not seem to understand or care about the severity of this. Allergies are very common these days and other airlines I've traveled with make adjustments to ensure the safety of their passengers but this was not the case with Air India.

I contacted them using the (business and first class!) telephone helpline, where I was forced to wait in a queue for over 2 hours only to be told I must submit my claim via the feedback section of the website.

This I did on 2 occasions and both times the request was ""acknowledged"" but nothing has happened since (the last entry was on 24th August 2019).

I have also contacted my travel agent and they have also requested a refund from Air India on at least 5 separate occasions.

To date, Air India refuse to either refund the difference between ticket classes or even engage with me (or my travel agent) in any meaningful way and now even after 7 months they continue to ignore me!

On the day of our departure we received a message from Air India advising that the flight had been rescheduled to 18.50 with a later arrival time of 20.30.

At Dabolim Airport, having endured one of the longest and slowest check ins, at the desk we were informed of another slight delay till 19.00.

The aircraft actually pushed back from the terminal at 19.55. The aircraft was finally airborne at 20.05.

We were informed that the flight time would be 1 hour. The Captain did apologise for the delay and advised that is was as result of a delay to the incoming flight from Mumbai. He also informed passengers that the temperature in the cabin was maintained at 23 degrees, it certainly did not feel like that as it was rather chilly on board.

Although the seats were not the most comfortable, ok for the length of this flight, the legroom was rather good.

During the flight we were served a snack, consisting of a finger sized coleslaw sandwich and a juice drink. Thankfully a small sachet of ketchup was also provided which gave the sandwich some flavour.

We actually landed in Mumbai at 21.05 which was 35 minutes later than scheduled.

Amazed that the Airline scheduled one hour and 40 for this flight, which is twice the normal flight of 50 minutes and still arrive 35 minutes late.

For those reads interested in types of aircraft, this one was an A321."

First of all if you check anytime at the Terminal for baggage check in, all other counters of other Airlines are operational but in case of Air India only a couple of counters are operational and that's why a big chaos of long waiting for your turn. Also they are very slow and lethargic at attending to the passengers. If you complain it goes unheard and only a barrage of excuses.

Same goes for the Security at Air India. There are huge lines running in rows as if you are standing in queue to visit a holy shrine 😄!! They are super slow and you are just looking at your watch not to miss your flight if you are a bit late which is very much possible given the state of Mumbai traffic.

Now the flight was scheduled at about 9 pm but consistent delays without any appropriate reason given by the personnel made us spend almost the whole evening at the Airport praying for the flight to be announced. It finally took off at about 11pm and we reached the city after 1am. No apologies whatsoever to be expected.

The food served on the Air India flight is PATHETIC to say the least. It's not cooked fully and no salt... Lacks complete taste and we pay for it compulsorily.

Some info about Air a India: They are owned by the Indian Government and are losing money. The Government is desperately trying to sell it off.

Here’s a summary of my return flight:

Flight out (Cph to Delhi):

Called to gate 1.5hours before departure, and was then left at the gate for hours, as the flight was an hour delayed.

The plane is a Dreamliner, but it’s really old and is very tired and tatty. It’s also very dirty. They have fold out tables and there was thick brown dirt in the fold of the table.

The toilet closest to my seat stank at the start of the journey. It smelt like someone had repeatedly urinated all over the floor and then it had been left to dry for a few days.

The inflight entertainment didn’t work. It seems you’ve got a 50/50 chance on whether this works or not.

The curry provided was ok. The breakfast was a very hard and dry muffin cake (no one ate it) and and equally dry croissant with butter.

When we were offered drinks, I asked for a Diet Coke, the person next to me asked for milk and another person asked for wine. We were told no to all and advised that they only had juice and water left (we were one of the first in economy to be served, so I guess they just hadn’t stocked up).

The staff are very blunt.

Return flight (Delhi to Cph):

I had to queue well over an hour to check in (you can’t check in online).

It then took well over an hour to get through security (lots of people pushing in the queue too). This isn’t Air India’s fault, but I thought I’d let you know, so you don’t miss your flight. The security queue is separate for men and women.

The flight was delayed 1.5 hours.

This time the inflight entertainment screen worked, but the socket for plugging the headphones was missing, so no sound. The flight information showing on the screen was incorrect - it was showing that we departed 30 minutes ago, when we’d actually been flying for a few hours.

The first meal we received was a frozen croissant with ketchup (??!!).

The second meal was a curry, but for some reason everyone else got yogurt with their meal, but I didn’t.

This time the toilets smelt like they had been cleaned.

For a fair part of the flight I had water from the air conditioning unit dripping on my head. Yikes!

Additional info: About two weeks before your flight, Air India email you to ask if you would like to bid on upgrading to business class (my flights were, minimum 450 USD for flight out and minimum 350 USD for return flight). I don’t know how much better business class would be, as it’s the same plane. You can only bid up to 2 days before your flight."

We found our flights extremely comfortable and pleasant in all areas. The service was impeccable, the food was presented in an orderly fashion and was tasty and enjoyable. The staff was very attentive and very helpful. We cannot fault anything or anybody during any of these flights. All of them did their very best to attend and please everybody and interact.
We enjoyed our flights this time very much, unlike last January 2020, which was a disaster in most respects. Air India has definitely improved tremendously since then.
We had 3 smooth flights (had some bumps now and again) most of the way going and coming and I congratulate the Pilots for taking us safely and landing the planes very smoothly onto each runway.
The only negative thing that I have to say, is that the material for the seats could be improved. they were not so comfortable to sit in or sleep on, some material/leather more softer and smoother would have made all the difference. maybe next time when I fly to India on a holiday, i'd find a more softer material used for the seats. Another negative aspect was that the bathroom could have some pull out tumblers to fill with water to wash the mouth.
I sincerely hope that Air India will live on forever and carry on their wonderful service that they gave us in January 2020.

On 22nd January 2020 after checking in at Chandigarh Airport we were told that the flight is delayed due to problems at New Delhi airport. The departure time of the flight was 7.05 Hrs in the morning. There was no body to apprise us as to what was happening. The flight from New Delhi landed at about 9.00 Hrs. At this moment I wanted to cancel my ticket and buy a new ticket on Indigo from Chandigarh to Bengaluru. Mr Harpreet who was at the Entry Gate for boarding the flight told us that I should not do so as the flight which has come from New Delhi will be going back after half an hour. I still went out of the security and approached the check in counter for permission to go out of the terminal to cancel my ticket. The manager on duty persuaded me not to do so as the flight will leave shortly. I again passed the security. But was told that the flight is not getting clearance to fly to New Delhi. Gradually the flight kept on getting delayed. Nobody told us that we could have snacks while waiting. On asking Harpreet, I was told that the snacks are already over and nothing can be done. His attitude was of indifference. Finally we boarded the flight around 1300Hrs. But it still did not take off. At about 1400 Hrs everybody started shouting as there was no manager available to explain as to what was happening. At this moment as the flight was not taking off, I was trying to purchase a ticket on Indigo leaving around 1500Hrs online. Because of poor internet inside the aircraft the booking was not completing. I told Mr Harpreet about this. He said he could help and called up the Indigo counter to check whether they had tickets available. He confirmed that he has got two tickets blocked for us and sent a person with us to take us there. I did not want to leave the flight but since he confirmed that the seats are there on the flight, we went to the Indigo counter outside the terminal. But were shocked to know that there were no tickets available. I asked the person who had accompanied us to make us speak with Mr Harpreet. Mr Harpreet flatly refused to come or help us in any way or speak with us.
Mr Mehta the Station Manager who came to aircraft around 1340 Hrs was most unprofessional. He was speaking rudely with everyone. He had no command over the situation. He refused to help us in anyway and was Rude to us as if we do not exist. If he had all the information and had passed on the correct information to the passengers on time then many of us would have made alternate arrangements.
We were travelling from London on holidays and flue with Air India. In the future we will never fly with Air India. Losing a day affected our short holiday in Mysore and we could not see it completely in the time left.
We had to pay for the hotel booking in Mysore (Radisson Blue) Rs 9900 plus 23.9% taxes and had to pay for our stay back in Chandigarh ( Hotel Hyatt) as well which was Rs 7000 plus taxes, as Mr Mehta said he could not speak with us. Even the lady who was at the counter for the cancellation of the tickets acted inhumanly and acted shamelessly. She refused to call any senior manager who could speak to us to resolve the grievance. Really shameful."

Very lackadaisical. Air India is the government carrier and the government is trying to sell it, but can't find a buyer, perhaps because they're been running it at a deficit for years and a buyer has to assume the debt. Investers understandably say, 'No thanks' and would prefer to just buy airplanes.

The good side: their luggage allotment is higher than other airlines, so if you have excess baggage, you might prefer Air India to other Indian carriers."

There was no audio or headsets, even though the Airbus A321 is equipped for same. There was no bottled water. There was no vanity kit. The Discover India magazine was fine. Magazines were offered. My seat [at least] did not have a copy of Shubh Yatra, the airline’s inflight magazine. There was a choice of four breakfasts, my omelet morphing into closer to a hard boiled/baked little square. The fruit was fresh; the java, weak but that is the bane of coffee in southeast Asia. Blankets were offered if you wanted to try to sleep. Other than a larger seat, it seems hard to justify the extra expense."

My husband and I Checked in at the counter and my carry on was slightly overweight. We asked if we paid to upgrade to business class could we take our carry on as we did all the other legs of our journey (business class and including in Mumbai yesterday). They said yes, so we paid to upgrade. After we paid for business class they told us we still had to pay for the extra 2 kg or so ($50 CAD). We were too frustrated to argue so we paid). They then gave us a voucher to use the Star Alliance lounge (assumes)that was standard when in business or as a Gold member. Guess it goes to show you can’t expect the same level of service across carriers and even same carrier in a different city. Also, although the service in business in the plane is quite nice, the interior is old and worn looking and the boarding process is chaotic/non sensical in the way the board (business class not called first). Overall, it’s unfortunate that Air India is a Star Alliance member. We have flown with many other members and this was far the worst."

However, we had to make changes after our initial online booking, and that was a nightmare. While trying to change ticket dates, I was on hold with Air India Customer Service for 7 hours. And I am not exaggerating. The Customer Service employees sounded like they were working on a loud, jammed trading floor. I could barely hear the employee trying to help me. Then we repeatedly got cut off and, of course, I had to start from scratch each time. You can never get the same Customer Service employee twice. And I rarely got the same answer to my questions more than once. When finally I was able to make the change I needed, Customer Service sent me a link for payment that never worked over the course of two days, so my date change did not go through. I was then forced to go through a US travel agency at the last moment that overcharged me and screwed up my connecting flight, forcing me to purchase an extra ticket to make my travel plans work. Just because of the consistently horrendous Customer Service I experienced with Air India, I would never recommend working with this airline at all."

1) We have seats on row no. 7, when we arrived at the boarding gate, the personnel there asked us to wait aside as he was calling passengers row wise. He never called our row and upon enquiring he casually checked us in with passengers of other row. If you have started a system, then you should have maintained it till the end.

2) the lunch provided on the flight was not at all upto the mark. It was not suitable for general palate.

3) after touch down it was announced that the luggage would be dispensed out of belt no. 8. However at belt no. 8 we saw that it was for Spicejet flight and the passangers of our flight had no clue from where to collect the baggage. After running around for some times we found out that baggage was on belt no. 6, but no one from Air India took the pain to inform us about this change."

And this happened twice, once from New Delhi - Varanasi, and again from Varanasi to Khajuraho, both times on Air India within the same week, so it took 4 hours, not counting check-in time, for a 1-hour flight.

In short, we spent 3 times as long waiting as the actual flying time. The flight itself was fine, but the delay and lack of information - no explanation or when the flight would actually leave - prompts this review. A 3-hour delay for a short flight is bad in itself and you can excuse the occasional delay - but twice? In the same week?

Come on, Air India, you're not the only airline in town, and unless you really have no choice, my recommendation on flying Air India is - don't."
