So if you are looking for a comfortable ride in these places, air India is highly recommended. Food is also probably the best . I have never faced any issue whenever I have travelled in Air India. I feel a lot of negative PR has happened for them .

Tip : While booking tickets , check the flight number first. Google it to check which plane is this. Example AI 101 goes to Delhi , but from there it goes to Newark , hence it is a Dreamliner. So you can choose a Dreamliner instead of usual narrow body A320"

My only problem was the 5 minute time change of our first flight (which we were informed of) and the resulting change of our connecting flight to one 4 hours later (due to the minimum transfer time in Mumbai) which we were not told about. We only found out about the extra 4 hour wait at Mumbai when we checked the status of our flights the week before we flew.
As it happened our first flight was delayed and we wouldn't have made the earlier connection anyway.
Had we known this we we booked we would have chosen different flights. With a big change in timings like this we ought to have had the option to change our flights or cancel the booking."

With difficulty we headed through the crowd and made it to the aircraft. On inquiring we were told that the aircraft departure is as per schedule. Notwithstanding we were the last to board the aircraft with difficulty.
The upgradation to Business Class was a boon as we could sleep all the way to Delhi. Adequate leg room and comfortable seats. The lunch served was however horrible. High time, something is done about the food served by Air India. Poor food in Business Class, I am surprised."

Flew economy a few times years ago. It used to better than what business is today, except the seats. The attitude of the staff has noticeably changed towards the worse. There is no excuse for a behavior when the stewardess gives a passenger a “rude awakening” by fast-tilting his seat forward to the point that he slams his head on the seat in front of him, just to force feed him his meal which he may be least interested in. On board staff seems “angry” all the time.

This new paid seat assignment is a nightmare. Air India’s frequent flyer program is difficult to navigate, I have given up on their KYC process. It is worse than applying for an OCI card. Ended up losing thousands of miles.

Business class is regularly filled with Indian government Babus, VIPs, AI staff, freeloaders. They handed out sleepwear to passengers, I asked for one later because none was given to me, and the reply was “we don’t have any”. Before take off, 3 different people asked us for our boarding passes when we were already in our seats, I asked why... no reason was given. Paid passengers are given this treatment.

Definetly a very un satisfying service. The plane is small. Old. But hey, you can’t expect ethiad airlines standards or KLM or Emirates for that amount of money. The size is not the biggest problem . It’s just a bit uncomfortable, but that’s all.

The problem is the crew and the level of hygiene.

The Stuart’s and hostess were highly unprofessional. We were flight at 8.45pm going towards India so for the majority it was a night flight. Now you understand some people might want to sleep, some want to eat, some want to drink. You cannot bother people waking them up shaking them from the harm if they are sleeping. I have never seen anything like that. In my previous flight to India with British airways and other trips around the world I have never been woken up or seen anyone being disturbed at 12am just for dinner. They leave it there and that’s it. What dinner then? A bunch of cold old stuff sealed in a horrendously presented plastic tin? Really bad. The crew are loud and do not take care of their customers. Really really bothering.

And that’s not all. The toilets were disgusting . Unacceptable and inaccessible. Dirty, filthy. Where is the maintenance? You need to keep it clean with that amount of people using 4 toilets for 8 hours.

Definetly I didn’t have such high expectations because the flight was cheap considering I bought it just 1month before, but I would have liked some decency. I regret not taking pictures.

It doesn’t deserve to be the Indian flag airline. Next time I’d rather pay £50/100 more than flying with them again."

Economy",Air India- Mental Torture and Corrupt Staff Members at Indra Gandhi Airport,"I recently traveled with Air India and had a horrible experience at Indra Gandhi Airport when returning back to the UK. The staff members simply don't know what customer service is about. They also are very ignorant of passport stamps as they struggled to find immigration stamp on his passport in spite of having it on one of the pages. They tried asking him for how much money I have and indicated I may need to pay somethings to get the information updated on my ticket. They seem to not know how to treat someone with basic human dignity.

My only 'fault' (if you want to call it that) was not to have checked in online and the connection flight in the UK was with BA. The shear lack of ignorance of Air India staff members was astonishing as they were unable to comprehend how he was able to get travel ticket from Delhi to Manchester with Air-India (Delhi to London) and then BA (London to Manchester) on same ticket. In spite of being their to help customers, their attitude was horrendous and not friendly but more having a chip on their shoulder either due to jealously or personal problems.

On the plane their media system did not work- which I have read from other reviews is not uncommon. Food as always was bland but that is relatively typical for any flight.

My suggestion is pay more and travel with BA or some other flight to India but ignore Air India completely."

The check-in lady wasted some time but after some urging, she was willing to allow me to check-in but her supervisor standing behind her said no need to entertain me and did not allow me to check in. It was an urgent trip for me as I had to report to job the very next morning and he said:- ""if your trip was urgent you would have come earlier"". If I am spending 7000 rupees the least I can expect is to be allowed to check in if the aircraft is parked in the airport with another 40 mins of time before takeoff. It takes atleast 15 min for the process of boarding to be completed and I was just 2 - 3 mins late to the counter closing.
Not only am I highly disappointed at this but also extremely angry due to this blatant looting of money in the form of denial of service when there is 43 mins to time to taking-off.
I will never choose to use the service of Air-India in future and make sure that my fellow friends and family and colleagues who are frequent flier never avail this sham of airlines until the need is dire.

Stay away and book the tickets in a slightly more expensive middle eastern flight, and you will be better off with a happy travel experience than paying less but for way too low standards for this flight.

Our flight, AI446 IXL-DEL, had been canceled on Oct 19, 2018 due to technical issue. We had arrived airport c. 9.45 until the 11.55, flying time, delay was announced. Given waiting for another 2-3 hr., eventually, flight cancellation was announced, thanks Air India (AI) to concern passenger safety first, but the whole terrible story just started!

Poor1 – no official announcement
After the official announcement of flight cancellation, we have to take care ourselves, no official recommendation from AI what to do next or contact any counter. Almost passengers (est.100-120) ran into staffs ask only their cases, and then foreign travelers got the last serve as we can’t compete with Indian people.

Poor2 – cannot handle with Indian people
When we are on the queue to book the hotel, Indian people don’t know how to “stay in the line” or “wait on the queue”, even we try to speak with them, no proper manner in return. They still stretch their arms with boarding pass over our heads and shoulder to get serve, fortunately, AI staffs even can’t solve the situation, they do first come first serve. I don’t want to summarize that almost Indian people be like this since there are some Indian guys give us their hands to help. However, when you were on the line in India, you have to protect your rights.

Poor3 – deficient transfer bus to hotel
This is not the 1st time AI encounter the cancel flight (as I asked them), but the arrangement was suck! Staffs cannot do it orderly, not enough bus for the passengers, even we waited for an hour to take the 3rd bus. At first, staffs try to push our group (10 people with 10 luggage) in the 2nd bus with limited space, even see by any eyes you can understand that it is not enough for the remaining of 20 people left with their belongings. Don’t know what staffs thinking and decide to do like that.

Poor4 – cheap inn represent your AI cheap brand
Staffs provided overnight stay with 1-star inn (or even less than), room has equipped with bathroom, bed, blanket, rug but all are dirty and not warm enough. At first, we did not accept this inn but bus had already gone (bring others to see other inns). We try to negotiate how much AI can pay, we will pay extra & find HOTEL ourselves. Staffs insisted if we find ourselves, AI is not responsible for any hotel & transportation costs. We try to contact our hotel to ask for available rooms but there is out of service area. We seem to have no choice as time around 18.00, sky getting dark outside. Staffs bluffed us that other inns not have hot water which was not true since we asked others when we met. Moreover, this inn was full of gas smell in all dinning & living rooms when they prepare dinner & breakfast.

Poor5 – dumb again on transfer bus to airport
AI sent free (medium size) bus to pick up passengers that stayed with our group last night, c. 20 people include 10 of us. After we carried our 10 luggage into the bus (1st time by ourselves), staffs said we have to move to another bus which, again, not have enough space for our groups. Staffs insisted & turn off the engine, so we carried down our luggage (2nd time with little help of staffs). We quarrel with staffs as they rush us to get into the bus by leave our luggage. I ask them since they have that free bus why we have to press into space that not enough. They said free bus will pick up other passengers (which is not true, they lie us again, no other passengers on this way). Eventually, we got the same bus by this time staffs carried our luggage since we had used up all our energy amongst thin air of Leh.

Poor6 – no preparation of cert. of cancellation
There was no preparation of cert. of cancellation in advance, as almost of over 100 passengers need this document. We had to wait the printing, stamping, and signing by AI Leh manager which not take it serious even we have less than 10 minute for boarding time. Hurrrrr

This is really damn management, your reputation is gone with this poor decision. We don’t want to solicit anything, just share our bad experience and hope you can improve your services. Given the Indian national airline and your slogan of Truly Indian, Air India is not only carry your own reputation, but also the pride of India."

Why hasn't AI's service has not improved all these years i wonder?

Even as Mumbai is a hub of Air India and check-in counters were open, I was allowed to check-in four hours ahead of departure only. They don‘t have own lounges for their premium passengers, but they use and airport lounge, which apparently is the better option, when considering their overall product. After boarding was completed, the plane was quite empty. The economy seating is really outdated and very dirty, you could see all the dirt in the tiny gaps in the personal screen area. The seats are uncomfortable in my mind. The flight attendants were something between rude and friendly and nothing to remember! The plane was not in a very good condition as I noticed. I would not fly with them again!"

Around 10 pm in the night just the day before Travel they drop a message that the flight is cancelled. Then tollfree keeps u waiting and online flight status was not updated for having been cancelled as it seemed unbelievable and a fantastic holiday was ending in nightmare. Then someone called to say if we can reach airport at Hubli by morning 7 am they can make some alternate arrangements to reach us at Bangalore so that we could take our next flight to Mumbai.
Tried explaining the person that Hampi was 4 hours journey from Hubli and with kids n young children making arrangements to travel at night is impossible.
Night 11 pm booked in SpiceJet at very high cost and next day requested them to cancel my tickets and issue a full refund.
The best part is despite all the mental agony and harassment, last minute hassles in the middle of night, extra financial burden on booking last minute in another airlines; AIRINDIA didn’t refund the amount in Full as if it was all my fault.
So never spoil your holidays with such airline. God save AIR INDIA."

The economy seats were good and spacious, food was good. Good connection to Indian cities and I can do customs at the destination city.

For the trip on first class, there were people waiting with my name at Delhi airport (as I was connecting from another city). They carried the luggage and we could not go to the lounge as we need to go through immigration and the flight was not on their computers yet (as I had more than 7 hours for flight departure). We waited in the lobby and went inside around 4.5 hours before departure. There were 2 people escorting us (and dragging our luggage) and went through the Delhi immigration using the first/business counter. Spent the time in first class lounge - had some time to sleep.

The seat was pretty good and wide and the amenities and food were good. The staff made the bed. The only thing complaint I have are - could not use the power ports to charge my ipad or iphone - not working properly - had same issues on several United flights as well. Movie choices are very limited.

The luggage came out pretty fast - was available after immigration.
Definitely better than Emirates from a customer service point of view."

At Goa airport I requested my bag be checked direct to Ho Chi Minh. The staff told me they would do it only upto Singapore. No explanation was offered. At Changi Airport, to my horror, I found myself in Immigration which I had to cross to get to baggage claim. Neither my travel agent nor the Air India staff had advised me that I would need a Singapore transit visa to collect my bag and connect to JetStar. The officials flicking through my passport found a valid US visa and gave me a one time pass to collect my bag and connect to JetStar. I was firmly told that on my return, I would have to possess a transit visa. I am a senior citizen and I was travelling alone. It was traumatic
On my first night in HCMC, I was surfing the net to find out why this was so. I came across Air India’s policy for Singapore and learned that it is mandatory for passengers to hold a visa for Singapore if they have an onward connecting flight operated through low cost carriers like Scoot, Tiger Airways, Air Asia, JetStar Asia etc.
Inter line facility is provided by Air India for passengers travelling on full service carriers like Singapore Airlines, Qantas etc. where they can check in and connect to these airlines without holding a Singapore visa."

The transit was reduced from 2 hours 10 minutes to one hour 10 minutes. Flying usually via Dubai or Doha, they advise 45 minutes minimum transit time. Air india website said 1 hour but I thought i'd ring and check.
First call, 18 minutes on hold, no answer.
Second call. explained why I'm calling, is 1 hour 10 mins enough for transit. Answer , no, and he hung up.
So I've been changed to a flight the airline knows can not be met.
Third call, demand a manager. Seems one hour 10 mins is too little. Offered a 9 hour layover in Delhi followed by a flight via Chennai with a 5 hour layover arriving 16 hours later than my original planned arrival in colombo. I obviously refuse that.
What next? I tell them Ive looked, refund my flight or change it to one day earlier where for some reason the connection time is 2 hours 10 minutes. Finally they agree to this and fortunately one extra day in Sri Lanka does not cause me any issues. But frankly they are hopeless and you have to be very alert and offer your own solutions."

- there seems to be a bit more legroom than on other lines; definitely more than Ethiad
- the overhead bins are quite large, and the airlines accomodates somewhat large bags (We had a bag with 3 motorcycle helmets in it and it was not problem)
Bad News:
- One wonders if the flight attendents have never learned to smile, or whether they were taught not to. They go by once with food, then clean, then coffee. They never check if everything is OK.
- Worst of all they darken the windows (no manual shades), turning day into night. It is absolutely oppressing to see the sun look like the moon in a black sky in the middle of the day. It reminds me of how we treat our pet birds: when we want them to sleep, we put a cover on the cage, and take it off at wake up time. Here it seems they wanted everyone to go to sleep so they would have no work to do once the food had been handed out (I will not say ""served""), and garbage collected. Then they turn on full lights (still not lightening the windows, as if they are waking us up when it is time for breakfast - at 5pm Paris time, before arrival.
This lighting is very disconcerting. I feel like an animal in a laboratory taking part in studies concerning light. The controlled lighting is a sufficient reason in and of itself to disprefer Air India."

We had 4 flights in total over the 2 weeks.
The planes were filthy, certainly not been cleaned in months. Everything was sticky, and smelt bad.
The food was just awful, I am a fan of Indian dishes, but these didn't even attempt to be either appetising or tasty. Honestly didn't know what I was eating.
There was only one crew member that was pleasant, and helpful. The others made a point of not being happy or helpful. I only asked for hot water to make a decaffeinated coffee (none offered on the flight) I did get the water but was refused a spoon! The seats are the most uncomfortable I have ever sat on, within 1hour of flying I was wriggling and had 8.5 more hours to go!
The entertainment was poor.
I entered the plane home healthy, having taken care throughout my visit to Delhi/Kerala/and Agra, but within hours of returning I was terribly ill, and required medication to recover. I am in no doubt where this illness was contracted, as I say everything was so dirty. I could not say strongly enough, Do Not Fly With This Airline. There is zero respect for their customers.

We wanted to overnight at Hyderabad after coming from Varanasi by INDIGO(nice service) and stayed at Taj Banjara overnight and visited relatives next day morning and went to airport at 12;20 pm to catch 2:40 pm flight to shirdi.

Our troubles started with check in itself. The check in staff harassed us that out hand luggage would not fit in the top and hence wanted us throw away things over 15 kgs
(later i saw that it fitted perfectly alright). Looking for money from travellers like us.

Next we were made to sit in flght for 2 hours and then were informed that flighs are cancelled for the day and then collect our luggage and then to to the booking office.

Booking office was on the 3rd floor and we are the last people to go there after collecting our luggage and finding our way after requesting many staff

We were told that we will get refund or next available flight subject to availability of seats. No assurance and the booking staff is 2-3 peolple only. They took atleadt 30 minutes per passenger to issue refund or reissue.For every transaction they were phoning duty manager to get his approval.

Finally when our turn came at 8: 30 PM they are not able to accommodate for the next day as there were no seats.
They offerred no option. Luckily some others were enquiring hyderabad-mumbai-shirdi flight option. We were told that the transit time is only 15 minutes and the system would not allow. After begging and banging the door and angry shouting from fellow passengers, they issued tickets for 2 of us after initially telling us that there are no seats
Surprisingly , the transit time as per the ticket is 1 hour 15 minutes(actulaay it was more than 2;:30 minutesfor us. Hyderabad to Mumbai flight was empty with about 20 passengers for 200 person flight and likewise Mumbai-Shirdi flight also was half empty.

We lost our precious time on that afternoon for waiting to rebook instead

Most unfreindly ground and booking staff. We are senior citizens and kept waiting to sort out our issues without empathy and had show our passports and oci cards to show that we are outstation travellers.

My main complaint is that why they lied about seat availability and flight timings. It would be a simple case to provide alternate booking if possible instead of haggling and harassing. We were just few 15-20 passengers who rebooked and it should take 2-3 hours to rebook in empty flights?

All in all this was my 2nd Air India trip after all and both had been disasters.

To substantiate: my trip date is 25th September 2018 Hyderabad - Shirdi air india flight

One more tricks by air india.They allot seats all in back rows and keep all front seats vacant so their service will be easy. For our HYD-MUM flight only last 6-7 rows are fully seated and rest are all empty - See attached photo"

Well - we flew from New Delhi to Tel Aviv with air India.
The plain is not clean inside, the seat pockets are full with junk, the personal screens covered with the leftover fingertips of the previous costumer.
It looks like an old plain.
The service: the staff do their best to be “after it”.
Our 3 seats (row 14 in the middle) all the personal media screens didn’t function,
Mine didn’t work at all, the other two - missing buttons etc,
I asked the staff 4 times - nothing done.
At the 5th time I got answer: I tried but I think it’s hardware problem.
Before serving the food we heard long and very strong noise from the kitchen- later we understood that it was ice breaking.
The bread was frozen so maybe they didn’t do a good job

We chose seats towards the front for which we had to pay nominal charges(other airlines charge much more). However there is an issue with the online seat purchase software. I finally managed to do so through a private operator whose link is available on the airline website(the helpline on phone also could not help). They allow you 25 kgs per passenger unlike 15 kg by Indigo.The flight was on time. The air hostesses were young(unlike earlier times) and dressed smartly. The seats are wider than normal though the upholstery could do with replacement. Air India is one of the few domestic airlines in India which serve snacks in the flight. The sandwich was decent. I recently learnt that Air India has the highest safety rating amongst airlines in India. The flight was without incident and comfortable. All in all a comfortable flight.

No greetings from the crew on entering. Just telling where is the seat and no smile on face. Seat did not had any comfort. Seats were like a seat of a small kid with no legroom. IFE should be rated zero. In the whole plane only 30-40 IFE were working properly and rest were just damaged. If you call crew for water they will come as if they don't want to help you. Food was the worse part. I ordered continental meal and they gave me indian. No taste in food. I got some pulses with rice and paneer. Rice and pulses were half boiled and paneer was made in tomato sauce. No serve of cold drinks on the plane, just a cup of tea and coffee. There were no lighting system in the washroom. Washrooms were like the seat, not even one person would get inside comfortably. Overall all my expectations for Air India had got down after my journey."

However when it comes to food it’s really disappointing. They had no non-veg options. The veg food was also a typical South Indian Fare like Upma, Uththapam, Sambar. With that they also had some cut fruits and a bun and of course tea/ coffee. God knows who has selected the menu and why their was no non-veg options. I would rather suggest them not to offer free breakfast but should have more options to select from and am sure nobody would mind paying for it either.

This actually had changed back in June and we found out coincidentally but Air India thought its ok to inform passengers just 4 days before (we can have no plans of our own, we are at the mercy of Air India).

Appalling service. The journey from Birmingham to Kolkata, screens didnt work and the cabin crew were so rushed that professionalism was out of the window.

On way back from Kolkata, we were not informed that the flight was domestic until Delhi, we left our home Kalyani at 2am to be there for International departure with 2 little ones half asleep. While checking in online our seats were changed!!! We were informed that the journey from domestic to international is very short and immigration would not take long but this is Delhi airport where there is no organisation!

The walk was long, the time was short and there was no help or assistance! The queue for immigration was so long and not a single staff was helpful. After speaking to 4 unhelpful people I had to put my foot down and get through via special assistance. No priority no management for people with infants. The left arm doesn't know what the right is doing, everyone busy shrugging responsibility.

On the flight, the faces and attitude the cabin crew had made me wonder if they are doing us a favour by serving. Is that a tack so people don't as for assistance? The screens and head phones barely work. The wait at Amristar was horrible and the snack served was pathetic. Although we requested child meal we were not offered and staff had no understanding of what I was explaining.

I chose Air India over Emirates due to the long wait in Dubai, its better to wait in Dubai then have such awful journey with yourselves!

Even though the aircraft was on bay for over one hour, the lavatories had not been cleaned. Instead, copious spraying of room fresheners was done to allay the foul smell but to no avail. the economy section of the aircraft retained its designer ""desh ki khusboo"".

The cabin crew were grossly under-trained. The essential cabin announcements, as mandated by regulations, were done in a lamentable manner, by novice cabin attendants. Although the cabin crew supervisor was on hand, no attempt was made to correct or intervene. Appeared as if was the airline training their crew 'on-the-job'.

I WONDER IF DGCA INSPECTS THEIR OPERATIONS?

The in-flight menu was a poor excuse for a meal. Thimble sized plastic cups for serving hot beverages and snacks that resemble 'road-kill'. Photos are attached for reference.

Although it is an Industry norm, no flight deck announcements were not made throughout the flight."

Economy",Where baggages gets lost in translation,"Firstly I travelled from my home-town in India i.e. Raipur to New Delhi (AI 469) from Air India and had this connecting flight to New Delhi via Air India (AI 161) again. To my nightmare as I landed after my domestic flight at Delhi, I found out that Air India had lost my luggage. I was going to the UK for about a year as a student and had some important stuff in the bag too and you may understand how stressful it could be to lose that bag. I had to also check-into my international flight about 12 hours later so I was really worried. When I asked the Air India people they simply said that they do not know where my luggage has gone. After requesting them several times at regular intervals they became rude and just started to make excuses. Even 6 hours after I had lost my bag they were not able to trace where has it gone, or in which part of the country was it in. With all the modern tracking and tagging and barcoding technologies on the luggage, still, they just could not tell where my bag was. They used to say that the there office at the other cities airport where they suspect my baggage could have gone is not picking up the phone. It is really the height of excuses and unprofessionalism. You can think how irresponsible of them it was to say that their own office in the other city is not picking the phone when called from the other office in New Delhi. And if it's true it's more alarming since if the offices do not pick up the official calls will they be picking any call from any customer itself? There were very big negligence and irresponsibility on the part of the airlines and the way they were dealing with the customers.

In the international flight, the remote of the in-flight entertainment system was broken. The seats were good, the food was decent. However, unlike in the few other airlines, they provide 2 full meal and 1 snack meal. The flight overall was comfortable but the luggage fiasco would still carry a big blemish for this airlines for me and I still would not recommend you travelling through this airline after I have had this horrific customer experience."

Good leg room (and I have long legs so I would know). Decent food (I was never left hungry because enough meals/snacks were served throughout the flight). Smooth flight/smooth landing. Decent choice of Entertainment (I say 'decent' because I'm a person who enjoys English entertainment only, but for someone who enjoys both - I guess it's better than decent).

Minor delay but I guess that's something that just happens and it can happen to any airline/flight.
However, they do make up for the delays (if any) in travel time.

Another really good point to be noted is - If the flight has been boarded by all the passengers, they do not waste time even if it before schedule. The flights departs as soon as possible. That's awesome."

Pros : why I will fly again :)
- its a direct flight YEAA !! Finally we have a direct flight from Copenhagen to Delhi with a total flight time of 7 hours. For sure it beats flying 14 hours including transit time with other airlines. AI also has direct flights from Stockholm to Delhi.
- if you book well in advance like 6/7 months ahead, the price is quite competitive and comparable to the other airlines. But be prepared to pay thru your nose if you book a month before the flight. I booked in advance and paid around 460 euros one way.
- Dreamliner comfort - new planes with comfortable seat rows and good legroom.
- Baggage - You get 41 Kgs weight allowance per person in economy. This is amazing, something that other airlines just dont offer. Keep it up Air India.
- I understand that Air India has some of the most competent and experienced pilots in the industry and it could be so because the takeoff and landing was smooth and effortless for the passenger both ways (I flew back AI as well). Very reassuring !!

Cons : potential for improvements.
- Food & service - not the best and can be improved if AI makes an effort. Airline food is tolerable in most airlines anyway except maybe Emirates. But what AI really needs to work on is the service offer. India is known for its hospitality and I am sure the ambassodors in the sky can do better. This is of course a general comment because one of them really went out of her way to make you comfortable with a smile. Maybe the others were just simply bored !!
- inflight entertainment is a joke. Old movies with limited choice, poor display and heavy touch screen controls makes a deadly combination. You need your own Ipad or music to keep entertained.

So two potential for improvement and so many good things going for them. Not bad at all considering that these issues can be fixed if someone makes an effort."

The outbound was so strange. In the middle of the seat, there was a cover that was just falling off. When off, we could see into the airplane. We gave up in the end and just had full access to the insides of the plane.

My wife's TV didn't work, at all, and we barely got an apology. Fine, it's a night flight anyway.

We didn't get a single smile from our stewardess. Not a single one. She wasn't rude, per se, but she definitely wasn't concerned about us feeling welcome.

When it came time for dinner, it was a 'chicken or meat' choice. Literally, like that. ""Do you want chicken curry or meat?"" OK, we'll both have the chicken.

She comes back after a while and says, ""I've got a suggestion. Why don't one of you have the meat?"" Er, no thanks, ordered the chicken. Turns out, they'd run out of chicken. So then she offers to go to economy and get one of their chicken dishes. We say we'll just take one chicken and a vegetarian something if they have it. They did.

The flight was smooth, the seats were comfy and we were on time. No complaints.

However! The flight back was the exact opposite.

Everything worked, the steward was friendly and happy, we had a full menu, including port and cheese, there was no hole down between our seats, and basically we got what you'd expect to get in business.

I have no idea what went wrong with the outbound.

Am - oddly - giving them another chance in February 2019. Only time will tell."

The seat was comfortable for 6 feet 1 inch tall person like me. They served dinner in the flight that includes pretty much sufficient food with tea / coffee. The food quality was best among all Indian carriers. The boarding and de-boarding process was smooth. Whereas touch down was smooth as always with Air India. I cant expect more then this in Domestic sector.

The remote controls of both seats were dead, despite repeated software resets by crew it was useless.
The embarrassed crew requested me to fill the feedback form which I did.

On arrival I complained to Air India Mumbai and the duty officer requested me to make a complaint to Mrs. Tripti Majumdar.
Her email was simply a reply of denial, she even had the audacity to mention that the policy of Airindia is not to refund for paid seats.
To add insult to injury the flight from Madrid was delayed and thereby connecting flight to Mumbai was, and the journey back was 34 hours.
Air India service on flight is at par with the best, sadly the ground staff have ruined this beautiful airline created by a master JRD Tata.
The maintenance staff simply don’t care.
Result. You can see the report card everyday.

Aircraft’s were clean seats comfortable leg space good I hope I could say the same about the snacks they serve which were not nice .

The smile on the face of crew which one is so used to seeing in other airlines was missing the air host looked like clerks from a government office . Rather on deplaning at delhi the pilot was standing on the door of the cockpit giving dirty look as if the passengers are responsible for the delay in salaries or non payment of flying allowance.

Still overall the experience was very efficient oops I said it to soon the luggage announced to arrive on belt no 2 arrived at belt no 5.

On the route I flew, ARN-BKK with a layover in Delhi, they operated with 787-Dreamliner, and unlike for example Qatar's Dreamliner Air India doesn't have the media box in the leg room. Instead they put it directly under the seat, making for much, much more leg room. I recently flew with Qatar's Dreamliner and the leg room there is horrible.
IFE was decent, not the best I've seen but not bad either. Food was good, and they offer free drinks including spirits. Cabin crew was polite and offered water and snacks on several occasions. The only negative on my journey was the long stop in Delhi, but I knew that before flying and it was a choice I made. All in all, for what I paid, Air India offered great value. As a side note, at boarding they offered business class upgrades for a decent price, I didn't take it though."

The aircraft is beautiful and spacious. The cabin was well maintained and clean. Seat very comfortable and spacious.
Although Air India still has old ladies who should be looking after their grandchildren working as stewardesses, they have younger staff also. Luckily for us, our seating was being looked after two young energetic guys who were always around, politely serving the passengers and taking care of requests. I will give them a five star rating for their service.
Take off and landing was smooth and overall a very content journey. When the tickets were booked, the family was sceptical to travel Air India as we normally fly Emirates, however they were also satisfied.

I was told there is a lack of staff however when I reached my boarding gate I again requested assistance from the lady at the air India kiosk and earnestly requested her for some assistance as I was completely out of breath. She was extremely rude and spoke unreasonably. My recommendation is even if you are unable to provide assistance atleast be courteous to passengers.

Most Important is to counter-check the seat #s. We reserved 3 seats together but on our flight back from DEL we all were in separate seats. In India they mentioned, it's soft reservation online while buying tickets and we were supposed to reserve it again 48 hrs before flight!!! It took us 1 hr to get the seats together with our toddler kid.

Experience from IAD to DEL: Only drawback was the service. No one came to collect trash except after the meals were served. No snacks or drinks in between.

Experience from DEL to IAD: Staff was amazing. Came to came to collect trash multiple times. Had a section at the back with Veg sandwitches, cookies and a drink cart for self service. The crew would make tea/coffee on request, paying special attention for the amount of milk and sugar.

Same plane goes back and forth. Many of the monitors or head phones were NOT working (Please have a backup plan for kids). Washrooms were OK but ran out of toilet paper towards the tail end of flight(carry a back-up), senior passengers took long and may knock on washroom doors if they are waiting :-)

Economy",Air India,My husband and I flew from Milan to Sydney via Delhi. Booking in was efficient and each leg of the flight left on time. The staff were polite and efficient. The entertainment system provided good choices of movies. The food was generally good with one lunch of chicken curry being excellent. The plane on the first leg was older and a bit shabby but the plane on the second leg was newer and sharper with water bottles provided for all passengers. Delhi airport was a comfortable place for a stopover with a range of places to eat and relax. We would highly recommend this airline.

I usually try to avoid Air India because of some previous bad experiences. I was returning from Istanbul to Bangalore (Bengaluru), and Turkish Airlines issued a ticket which gave me a routing of Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Mumbai and Air India connecting flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru. The flight from Istanbul to Mumbai was on time and uneventful. At Mumbai, at around 5.15 am, the Air India staff gave me a boarding pass for the AI 639 flight to Bengaluru scheduled at 9.20 am. As I crossed the security gate, I saw the TV screens showing the flight time delayed to 12.10 pm (about 3 hours). It seems the staff at the checkin counter knew about it but still issued me the boarding pass to this flight. Meanwhile, another earlier Air India flight was leaving at 6.15 am to Bengaluru with empty seats. The staff had made no attempt to try to accommodate passengers like me who were in time for it but were scheduled on the later flight. I went to the staff to ask about options. They were so callous about it. I was asked to contact Turkish Airlines, and then the staff of the 2 airlines got engaged into a ballgem passing me back and forth between the two. I walked back and forth between counters and offices for about 2-1/2 hours. Air India seems to have completely lost the point that a flight scheduled for a certain time is expected to fly at that time. A couple of other flights of other airlines departed (to Bengaluru) during that time, then, the staff coolly told me that there are no other flights until 12.10 to Bengaluru, I had missed any of the other airlines so what choice do I have?? So I sat back to wait. I asked about refreshments for the lengthy delay. They told me i could go to a food outlet called Indian Kebab. So, I tried to find it. It was well-hidden and you need googlemaps and a guide to find this place. After locating it, I found it closed. If I wanted to complain, I have to go back out of the security because there are are no Air India staff to assist passengers anywhere else. What a brilliant plan!!!!
I am Indian by birth and spirit, and in general would have preferred Air India to other airlines simply because it is Indian. Unfortunately, the staff and management seem to go out of their way to ensure that they do every little bit to discourage anyone from using this airline."

In order words I can term it as horrible. It was a long distance flight and I certainly expected better comfort from Air India. Highlighting my review in detail below.

Recline - Horrible. The push button to recline the seat was missing and I traveled the entire 12 hour journey in upright position. Lots of passengers faced issue wherein
Legroom space - good, one can easily move in and out
Seat comfort - Pathetic. Stained and no cushions in the seat
Foot Rest - bad condition. They were free and could not be maintained at required height.

Food - Below Average. Cold food was served which wasn’t tasty either. It was hard to gulp down the food. Croissant shared in the morning were soggy. Even the water shared for tea was absolutely cold.

Hospitality - Pathetic. Air hostess was quite cold and even on raising alarum calls, they would not come at your seat. One has to eventually get up and reach pantry area to get the required help. Food was served in haste and there was no gap in between the welcome drink and the food served. It appeared that they had to wind up everything quickly so dump stuff as quickly as they could.

Flight checkin and travel time - Excellent. We reached 15 min early than the arrival time and also the checkin experience at Paris Airport was good.

In flight Entertainment - Average. Wide variety of movies were there however the head phones were distorted. Majority of them had voice cracking issues and low sound quality.

Hope the above review helps when you decide to choose your flight. Happy Travelling."

Poor than the low cost airline. No wonder why this airline is at brink of disaster, was told that occupancy is so low that they are forced to bring such aircraft, Which means there will be literal drop of pax and hence route unviable.
Singapore airlines offers amazing service and I fly one Delhi sing sector with them. Feeling let down and depressed. Will check in future before flying air India"

They hardly serve any food on the flight. Attendants go into hiding after serving food. This is the only airline where they slice a croissant and put cheese in between and serve for breakfast - the only item. What if we are allergic to cheese? No water or beverage served, except with their horrible meals - one scanty breakfast, one small lunch and one snack. It is a pathetic flight."

Reminded me of my last flight on United. The male CAs were kind of okay and friendly, but one young female CA seemed she had better things to do.
Seats and tables were relatively worn, but probably as expected on average A321s in Asia.
One thing I was quite surprised was that many passengers were on cell phone out loud though the plane was already moving away from the gates. CAs did not seem to mind. Last passenger to stop, or so it seems, did so when we were on the runway.
May be the rules changed? I know that radio waves seldom have negative impact on the flight itself, according to some research, but loud voices are nuisance.
The web-sites did warn about large voices exchanged even after lights are turned down, and I confirmed that, along with some fancy Indian music played loudly from smartphones. Can't blame them as there were no on-flight entertainment, naturally.
Meal was quite good, I must say, for an economy class, as I am fond of Indian spicy foods. Indian wine, which was my first, was actually not bad as well.
It was interesting, as the isle is so narrow, CAs had to forcefully bump into seats many time to move the wagons through.
Again, thanks to many advance warnings, I was not too surprised."

Many passengers were govt employee so you know what happened when they board, they actually feels air India is owned by them so you can't help.

People were Crossing line putting bags and Air India staff give privilege to all those Govt employee without thinking others has paid too.

Well on boarding it was Kind of ""ok' to me. Food was just nice nothing fancy...most importantly flight was on time.

Business Class",Air India Revisited,"I did the reverse flight (DEL-MEL) in Business Class last year and said I'd only travel with AI again if there was no other option; the experience was pretty rugged (see earlier review). As the only India-Australia direct flight, AI has a monopoly on this sector. For me, one long-haul flight is better than two flights with hours hanging about another airport. So I was prepared to risk it again. This review updates my earlier experience.

My daughter and I travelled together in Business Class on the SYD-DEL sector. The experience of travelling to India from Australia was so different from my India to Australia journey last year that it could have been with another airline. The ground staff were not only warm and welcoming, they were downright helpful. A minor hiccup in our booking was straightened out rapidly and without fuss. The flight staff were also engaging and helpful, offering refreshments at the right times, smiling and being like the staff of other airlines. We received a useful amenities pack at the beginning of the flight, rather than at the end as was my last experience. It was an amazing difference and the flight was very, very good.

The Dreamliner is a relatively quiet plane and the business class beds are quite flat and comfortable. The staff helped us with blankets and quilts (although they didn't have enough to go around, so they were suitably apologetic).

The food was excellent and there was a reasonable amount of choice. Other airlines offer a printed menu to allow business class passengers to contemplate their options and see what between-meal snacks might be on offer. AI does not do this, but it would be a welcome addition. Please do this, AI!

AI still needs to sharpen its act in the air. The planes look pretty tired and as a passenger I wonder if the cabin maintenance mirrors the mechanical maintenance (ouch).

Given this very good experience I'll take AI again on the India-Australia run. I wonder if it's always better in one direction than another?"

Both the flights are superb . You always get a warm gesture by the crew on both of this flights. The check-in is quick. The food quality that is provided is just awesome. It is fresh always. Yes, there are delays for the flight but that has to be understood by travelers as the airspace for both of these airports is congested and being the night flights international traffic have to be given a priority. But the delay is very minimal as it gets covered up en route. Also you don't have to wait for hours to collect your baggage.

I can accept that sometimes nothing can be done, however it's when no attempt is tried that you wonder if really this was just down to people or a corporate style. No attempt to explain, no attempt to look for alternative seating, no empathy and certainly no sympathy. A hostile customer stance.
The worst thing was that when we returned and logged an official complaint no attempt at contact aside from the usual return e mail confirming receipt.
I guess you get what you pay for and we deserve trying to shave a few pounds off the flight but it was a learning curve. I would never fly with this airline again, nor because something wasn't technically working but because of the distain that passengers are held ."

Once on the flight, everything looks dated. Not all of our chairs fully reclined, and I’m not sure if the food or service was worse. The flight attendants were completely inconsistent- my daughter received a toiletries bag, but others did not. I had to ask twice before receiving one. Only 3 of us received duvets. After my father asked twice, the flight attendant showed him that they were in the overhead bin, where he could get one. They also ran out of salmon in both directions, so several members of our party were forced to order the mush that they called food (and subsequently didn’t eat). They only had nuts for snacks....I could go on and on. Needless to say, we will never fly Air India again."

So my carryon bag I had to use a checked bag, which had a lot of personal stuff in it so not very happy about being without that. I even contacted them, and they said they would call me but never did. The bag only weighed like 24 lbs, but it had to be under 18 lbs. I don’t know what my bag looks like yet and if anything is damaged, but when I arrived in Delhi, my bag had been banged up and ripped, as was my luggage tag. We’ll see if it was just a one time thing, but I’m betting it wasn’t. I will give it a 6 out of 10, but not happy with regards to their all around handling of luggage."

I would recommend choosing any other full service carrier for this route or a budget airline.Avoid Air India.."

The aircraft each time was meticulous ly clean. So was the toilet. No lavatory smells pervaded the cabin.
The crew were well groomed, charming, and young. Which made them polished and chic....on each flight.
I don't eat on flights but the presentation of the food was as good as international flights. Pity only Indian is served but it was well cooked.
Most important. The aircraft was an Airbus A320 NEO. NOTICABLE FOR ITS QUIET CRUISE.
And landing EACH TIME at the runaway at Bhubaneswar was well orchestrated by the Senior Captain.
If they can Make these flights in India why do they have such a pathetic reputation? Remember I said 8 times."

But I must admit that it was actually better than my expectations. I wouldn't call it the best airline I have flown with but it was good enough.

I loved the food and also liked the collection of movies they had in their in-flight entertainment system. Found the crew the members welcoming.

There was a gate change for the delayed flight too which was communicated over the PR very late, but i guess thats bad service by the airport and not the airline. Even though the flight was delayed 45 minutes because the aircraft arrived late from the previous trip, the crew was patient and friendly in updating the status to awaiting travelers promptly.
There was a food on the flight which i wasn't expecting and unlike the notorious airline food, this was actually an excellent quality meal.

At the airport, at Air India baggage screening I was asked if I was carrying mobile phones in my check in baggage which I was. It was for the first time that I was asked to remove the phones and keep in hand baggage. However, I was exempted from removing the same when I informed the staff that the phones were Blackberry phones and were in power off mode. Check in was smooth and barely took a couple of minutes. Incoming flight 629 arrived a few minutes before time and hence all passengers were on board well before time. However, we were made to open our hand baggage again for security checking at the time of boarding the aircraft and told that this was a airline requirement. Anyways, we had the most comfortable economy seats in terms of space and enjoyed the chill of the blast from the air-conditioning. The safety detailing was the poorest I have ever heard on any aircraft. i had asked for a Vegetarian Continental meal but we were served some piping hot rice with dal and brinjal veg that I absolutely loved. Liked the way the Flight Officer shared information on the aircraft we were flying and its variants, the height we were flying at and I was thrilled to know the path we were flying. Flying over Akola, Bhusawal, Jalgaon, Dhulia, Nashik and then descending into Mumbai.

Believe it or not we landed at Mumbai International Airport a whopping 35 minutes before time Can you beat that!!!!!"

Contrary to what I heard about Air India, this flight experience was far superior to other US based airlines that I had been traveling internationally in the past 19 years. The staff was very pleasant and eager to serve and make you happy onboard and during the check in.

If you like Indian food, then this flight offered above average food options. I did not not opt for Alcohol though they offered duting in-flight service.

The bathrooms were relatively clean and not worse than other US airlines. The price I paid was reasonable too.

The best part of this flight is that it is less than 14 hours stratight to Delhi. You save valuable time. I did not experience much jetlag due to the flight timings, both going in and out. My flight reached before scheduled time both at DC and and in Delhi.

I would definitely recommend Air India for this route. Only suggestion is that you carry your own entertainment and not rely on theirs. Theirs is not reliable and I saw several screens were not working, including mine. My children had working screens, so it was not an issue for them.

I hope that Air India would invest money to make the interior of this aircraft comparable to other Gulf based airlines. However I would rather fly direct to Delhi than to reach Dubai in the same time that it takes and then spend another four to six hours to reach Delhi.

If you can ignore cosmetics and in-light entertainment issues then this is the flight to take to go to Delhi from DC. There is no other flight connection faster than this direct route."

However, the movie selection was awfully limited, plus my headphones and my next of seat’s were not working. In order to get some new, the button for calling a member of the staff was COMPLETELY useless. Having been given two faulty pairs, I had to walk down the aisle twice to finally get a third (functioning) pair. We had been given lunch, which was good, although the hostess could not give exhaustive info about its content: she just said “chicken or mix veg” and could not be bothered to say more. Although lunch was tasty and warm, the following snack was a freezing cold croissant. I managed to sleep during most of the flight, even if my seat was the last one before the toilet, positioned next to the aisle, and therefore get kicked most of the times a completely careless hostess/host would pass with the cart. When I woke up and asked for a cup of tea stopping a hostess down the aisle, I could not tell whether she said yes or no as she mumbled something without making eye contact. After 10 minutes of wondering whether or not she did understand what I asked for, she then came back with a tea which was not hot anymore, and in which there were already sugar and milk (I am lactose intolerant).
So, overall, just a bad service with employees looking at you as if they were doing you a favour, probably forgetting that I have to pay what for me is a big amount of money to travel with them. As a post scriptum, I would also like to point out that I can imagine the struggles that the job implies being a waitress myself: but I also think that if you cannot give your customers a smile and try being as much helpful & well-disposed as possible, hospitality is definitely not your ideal career."

However the hostess misbehaved with two to three passengers on board. Particularly with a woman passenger who neither understood Hindi or English (probably her first flight) sat on a wrong seat and couldn't find her family members. Cabin crew ended up being apathetic. I myself pressed the call button twice and the hostess was too busy selling products that she didnt cater to come and ask what I wanted.
When i got angry and pressed the call button 5 times she shouted on me for doing it. On telling that I needed water and it was an urgency she retorted saying water is not an emergency of any type.
They charged for a business class whereas there is no business class on the flight."

Economy",Washington to Delhi; recommendations to Air India,"My first trip to India was on AI with my family a very long time ago from NYC with several stops along the way. We loved our trip, the Maharaja’s staff and food. Since then, I’ve traveled different airlines in various parts of the world, including government run ones big and small.

When AI started its non-stop service from Washington in 2017, I happily took it again. Sadly, the standard of this flight is starkly much below my first early experiences; not what one would expect from India’s flagship today.

Here are observations and suggestions from my round trip from IAD to Delhi (Oct/Nov 2017):

1) With all the tech professionals India produces, can AI not provide us with Wi-Fi for the 14-15hour flights?

2) The TV monitors and service was out-of-order much of the time on both legs – no entertainment is entirely unacceptable.

3) Make sure the seats are cushioned and covered adequately (an issue of supervising the tailors?); the headrest covers were missing.

4) Add a positive attitude to flight service; the crew ignored calls for service between meals, and seemed not to enjoy serving people.

5) Beverage service was not provided until hours into the flight, and not enough. Other airlines are much better – some are very frequently coming through on even 8 hour flights. 15 hour flights need more hydration is needed.

6) Meals are full of carbohydrates, too salty and spicy (not tasty) - rather unhealthy for such a long flight. India has yummy healthy cuisine that I am sure the chefs can whip up if asked. Simple dal, chawal, and real sabzi (not paneer) would be fantastic – add a little pickle packet and a couple green chillis for those who want to spice it up.

7) And how about plain yogurt with our meals - this one fabulous part of Indian meals is missing.

8) A pouch of sonf would be a nice touch with each meal!!

9) Whole fresh fruit for snacking would be a welcome and healthier option, as offered by most international carriers.

I hope you are reading this AI, and take these suggestions as intended - constructively.

Make us proud, again.

p.s. At this point, the only reason to fly AI IAD to Delhi is the flight timings."

The timings of the flight and the cost make it a very attractive option. The flight leaves New Delhi late night and by early morning you are in JFK.

There are no food menu on the flight (though special meals are served) which is fine as most travellers are Indians and they don't take any meal except chicken or vegetarian. The airline believes in good service and comfortable flight. Nothing fancy and that's what on offer as well.

Ground staff is helpful as usual and prompt. FA's are nice and helpful as well. If you talk with them nicely (and not boss around) they are really helpful and you can chat about what to do in the city you are travelling to.

The middle east airlines are highly overrated, specially their economy cabins and do not offer anything extra that Air India does not. After all, the people travelling are also same.

Etihad and Emirates operate A380 to JFK with a 3-4-3 configuration, whereas Air India operates B777-300ER with 3-3-3 configuration. So, the cabin feels much more open and relaxed and not at all conjusted. Also, this means no waiting for restrooms and quicker check-in, baggage claims etc."

The flight itself was fine, we enjoyed the food in the main, found the service from the cabin crew efficient if not overly friendly (not a problem), and the inflight entertainment was better than I expected. There were no issues with dirty toilets as stated in other reviews and passengers were much better behaved and quieter than on many chartered flights. I was surprised that there was no opportunity to purchase duty free etc on board, neither could you purchase drinks or snacks etc BUT as food and drink was provided this was a nice surprise rather than being continually asked to buy different items.
The main negatives for me was the uncomfortable seats and trying to contact and communicate with Air India - as I had purchased our seats via an agent I failed in just about every way to contact Air India to check that all paperwork etc was in place for the flight. I eventually (after many failed attempts) spoke via the online chat which allayed any fears and also reserved seats for us but I couldn't contact them to do so for the return journey. The online checkin for the return journey allocated us seats in different rows and stated there were no other available seats! At Newark, the checkin staff helpfully allocated us seats all together, and that flight also had many empty seats! Beware the website and online options for the airline was the bottom line for me.
I would fly with Air India again but like many things it would depend upon the price and the price of other operators."

The good points first - boarding was a breeze and we left on time and landed in Mumbai early (despite the awful weather on arrival). Chicken was surprisingly good albeit a tiny portion. Multiple bad points though... The 777-300 ER was a mess. Like a mess. My seat was broken and looked like it had been left for a few years in a garbage dump (complete with sweat stains on the arm rests and an absolutely nauseating smell the likes of which I’ve never experienced on an airplane before (and I’ve flown on some pretty sketchy airplanes). I’ve also never ever been on a flight which had zero beverage service. Not water. Not juice. Not soda. Keep in mind this is biz class and it wasn’t a cheap ticket. Service was non-existent and the FA gave off an interesting “I hate the world” kind of vibe. Moral of this story is Air India should be ashamed of themselves. If you want to experience who I suspect is the worst carrier in the world (I’d take Air China in a heartbeat), I heartily endorse Air India. If you don’t, you’d be wise to RUN away from them.

Food served was average, Business class seats is a flat bed but I had to lay a blanket on the seat because the seat made me itchy.

With the headphones they provided you could not hear anything because they were of such bad quality. I would recommend taking it your own headphones on the flight."

The room was serviceable - if it was on a tropical island I would complain how basic it was - and perfect for a quick sleep.
I went to get a meal and had to argue my case with the waiter who thought I only got free breakfast (we were due to leave at 3am), and the mutton curry was all bone shards, but the vegetable curry was excellent (which was lucky cos it was the only other dish.)
As it was free it seems churlish to complain, but I'm just being thorough.
The flight was very comfortable and the staff were exceptionally helpful. The airline good was great; the only niggle was a broken entertainment system on each leg of the journey."

Starting from check-in counter, least interested in good customer service, they are there just to do their job of collecting luggage( I mean where is the politeness?), then you move on to the boarding gate: as usual, Air India flights are late and the boarding staff have no idea of tackling the customers at that time (maybe they don't get adequate information). Now if we talk about the in-flight experience, there are screens attached to each seat but they don't work. Cabin Crew is pretty out of trend as compared to the other carriers. ( Maybe they are not trained about good customer service). Is it a crime to be a non-vegetarian if you are travelling on an Air India flight? What kind of rule are they imposing on us? Only vegetarian meals in the domestic sector. Let me also mention the aircrafts they are plying in the domestic sector: ""Worst than a 20-year-old state transport bus. It freaks the hell out of me while Take-off and landing.

My recommendation NOT TO ENTER this lounge and rather go to the Premium Plaza Lounge opposite to this Lounge which is just eating Real Estate Space in a premium Location.

Coming onto the flight, on the whole a comfortable flight however an old aircraft A320 which has its own issues plus the icing on the cake is the Air Hostess Onboard whom I have generally found to be rude.

I still recommend an Air India as compared to a Jet Airways which is even worse if you are flying an older Aircraft on your sector for the day."

What has ensued is the worst example of customer service I have ever encountered in 60 years of flying.  After dozens of emails and several phone calls, over a period of six months, I have yet to be able to find anyone who will do anything to rectify the situation, in any department at the airline.  Not only will they not live up to their obligations as a member of Star Alliance, and not only will they not even supply me with the details of my return flight (eticket number, seat number, flight number), they have now totally stopped responding to my repeated attempts.  It is a mystery to me how the Star Alliance has allowed this incompetent, unprofessional and, frankly, dishonest company into the alliance.  I have dealt with uncooperative customer service many times before, but this airline specializes in not doing what they are professionally obligated to do.

These marathon flights are about 13 hours long, so AI deserves a lot of credit for the safe journey. Food was served three times and it was good (Indian style cuisine). I took economy class and I don’t think it’s something I will do again because the leg room really stunk do and such a long flight. I considered business class, but it was about double the ticket price. I’ll have to research other airlines and possibly do a connecting flight. Economy non stop is a good value, but I’m not sure if it’ll do it again. Inflight technology was antiquated and I can’t believe the airplane did not have WiFi available. The cabin definitely needs a refresh and upgrade. The only reason I’d consider this flight again is they are the only non stop from NY. They really need to spend some money to spruce up the amenities and ambiance for the flight.

Domestic flights in India:
I traveled from DEL to Kolkata, then from Varanasi to DEL ok AI. I was very happy with the service. I actually took another airline from Kolkata to Varanasi because they were the only ones to have a direct flight and I was not happy with how they nickel and dime you. AI gives you hands down the best baggage allowance policy and they also serve you meals and refreshments on domestic flights. Economy was good because of the short distances. Definitely recommend AI as the way to go domestically while in India."

A few weeks later, received another email saying the flight had been cancelled and to contact them. Was already in India at that point so called from the hotel to be told the flight hadn't been cancelled, and that the time was the original one. Confusion reigned. Just to be sure, as we arrived in Amritsar we went to the airport to check in person, to be told the flight had been delayed but not cancelled.
To be allowed into an airport in India you have to have a ticket, so presented ourselves for the delayed flight time, only to be told we couldn't enter the airport because the flight had left at the original time and that we'd missed it! Turned out it wasn't true but had to talk our way in.
How can a so-called professional company such as Air India allow this to happen? I was without a phone (and internet much of the time) trying to sort out their blunders.

Here are the worst features of my travel.
1. No entertainment for 14+ hours flight. Several of the TVs are not working, if TV display works for few, either remote or headsets doesn't work.
2. Food tray table is bent and I had to literally hold the tray to keep the food in place.
3. Luckily my seat recliner worked too much and my next seat's recliner didn't work at all. I feel sorry for the guy sitting behind me, as my seat was gone too much back when I use the reclining button.
4. Food is not good at all. I traveled in Air India 10+ years back and at that time food was the only positive thing travelling in Air India, now it is bad. Tomato in the salad was smelling bad.
5. Flight is very old. Not suitable for travel for 15 hours.
6. I bought the ticket in Feb 2018 for travel in June and I called the airline and choose my seats. But in April 2018, when I checked my travel plan, all the seats I choose are changed and they randomly assigned seats. When I called back about this, I was asked to pay extra to get my original seats assigned back to me. Family of 4 got seats at 4 different places. I had to request other passengers to make adjustments. Finally 2 of my family member sat at one place and other 2 at a different place. Very very poor service regarding this.

The only positive thing in this journey was the leg room in the flight was better compared to other airlines.

I don't recommend this flight if you have other alternate flights to choose."

Also in lunch / Dinner/ whatever..four times...Rice Rice Rice Rice and Bread. I refuse to eat two time. I spent $ 5800 on 4 tickets and get this type of service ? Also the flight is not the international standard. Feel like sitting on hard board seat. Feel burning sensation around my butt after 6 hours. No more Air India.
Particularly, Air India has so much older people travelling...they do not know how to use the toilet. Water and tissue every where. Same thing for toddler...crying for whole trip."

On top of that they cacelled the domestic flight altogether. And gave alternate flight which has 14 hrs of layover in Delhi aurport. So I booked sleeping pod for them by spending 8000 extra. These air india people didn't allow to go to security so wasted 8000 as there is no refund.

Also they have boarding pass for Chicago flight for only father not mother. For her boarding pass they made them wait fot 2 hrs.

So guys don't get trapped in Air India trap of food and Hindi language. Which was my mistake.

PLEASE DONT TRAVEL USING AIR INDIA IF YOU DONT WANT TO GET FRUSTRATED.

THE STAFF IS VERY RUDE. THEY SHOW US SOME RULES AND POLICIES AND TRY TO EXTRACT MONEY AND GIVE MORE INCOVINIENCE.

Overall, the service of Air India has improved VASTLY over the last few years. Their UK flight from Delhi is also amazing. If you are not too stuck up on non-veg and appearances, the food and service on domestic flights is as good (or bad) as the other airlines.
So in this particular flight from Delhi to Chennai, I forgot my Kindle on my seat. My impression was that I could forget about it as I would never get it back. However, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.
I have never received more polite service from any other airlines in this matter. The baggage services (Mr. RajKumar at Chennai in particular) was very supportive in identifying, verifying and returning the device.
As this was not my normal route of flying, I went to collect the device after two months. I was amazed to find the same in pristine condition and had absolutely no issues in getting the same back.
Kudos to the National Airline. I hope they get out of the financial mess and rule the skies again."

Economy",Awful experience Air India team please pull your selves up,"The overall experience in a Dreamliner was made awful thanks to the cabin crew including one Mr. Kanth (can't remember his full name). There was utter confusion in the cabin post boarding - there was a big group of school students going back to India and they had been allotted different seats. They were requesting the passengers if they could help them so that they could sit as a group. The passengers were more than willing to help them out but the cabin crew was not making any efforts to help or clear confusion. I also on request changed the seat and got an aisle seat in the middle block. The school students were polite and helpful and one of them helped me with my handbag which had to be kept in overhead baggage area - I was not helped by the cabin crew - they were not even visible. There was no help being provided by the cabin crew. My seat was having some mechanical issues - I complained when the plane was on the ground in London but nothing was done. The seat pocket had used tissues, toffee wrappers and an empty water bottle (it had not been cleaned). The entertainment system on my seat was not functional. I rang the bell for the cabin crew 5 times but no one came. The plane left London and then they started serving refreshments with utmost disinterest. I informed the cabin crew member serving in our lane about the issue but he was not bothered. When he came back to clean the tray I reminded him again of the issue, he was still not bothered. After some time I dozed off as I was dead tired and had been having less sleep for the last 2 days. The dinner was served with utmost disinterest again. Why does Air India ask for meal preferences in the ticket when they were not interested in giving those meal options – the only choice they were giving is Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian.
Other thing which I realised was the cabin crew on this flight was at its shabbiest best – out of the 2 male pursers Mr. Kanth was having a pot belly and had a dirty uniform(wonder how was he surviving as a cabin crew member). The lady crew member was no better off – an elderly lady who again didn’t have an iota of smartness and alertness, she was looking tired and like a school teacher from some government school. Mind you I have seen some smart looking elegant elderly female crew members with Air India earlier also – this lady was far from that.
Once dinner was served the cabin crew team (including an elderly lady vanished behind the curtains). Even after half an hour with many people ringing bells, no one appeared. I got and walked up to the area where they were sitting and chatting away – gave my tray and asked them why were they not attending to the issues – Mr. Kanth immediately replied we know about your problem and would resolve once we are in Delhi – how would it help me once we are in Delhi as the flight is till Delhi only. He came down to my seat cribbing why couldn’t I sleep, why did I need the entertainment option and how overworked he was. He tried resetting the system, though he himself had told me nothing’s going to happen and then rudely told me that I better sit and wait.
After 40 minutes they started clearing the trays, most of the people had dozed off or were dozing off and it was really uncomfortable with those trays still there.
Another crew member Ms. Mousami appeared this time. She requested for something from Mr. Kanth and voila Mr. Kanth drops a dirty spoon and a small bowl from one of the used trays on my head. I was really angry now and asked them if he had some specific issues. Ms. Mousami was the one who apologised and not Mr. Kanth and was trying her level best to control the situation.
By this time I had realised the best thing to do would be to sleep and wait to reach Delhi.
It was really sad that there is so much being talked about how Air India, national airlines is going down the drain, but the Airline team itself is the one which is pushing down the drain.

I had travelled in Air India to London just a week back (AI161) and the experience was definitely much better. In this flight nothing was right – no cleaning, rude and shabby crew, no inflight safety information (on the entertainment screen), no introductions, nothing.
Air India – please retrain your crew members and have some benchmarks.
Will think twice before I take Air India again. No wonder I hadn’t picked my domestic connections with Air India – when they can be awful in the international leg imagine how they would be in the domestic leg"

However, this was no surprise to us. We knew that the girl at check-in wasn't telling us the truth and simply passed us on and left us to deal with the issue once we were on the plane. Sadly we were not the only family in the same situation. There were other two families who were in the same situation and somehow the staff moved them together by asking other passengers to move. It was a debacle. Another chaos was caused by too many large bags and items carried on the plane. There was simply no room for everyone to put their bags into the overhead lockers. Toilets needed regular cleaning. Otherwise, the flight was Ok."

The flight to Mumbai was smooth, uneventful, and on time. The plane was old and not as up to date as some of the other airlines (the seat next to me was broken), but the staff was kind and professional. The return trip was delayed 6 hours, and we didn't find out until we got to the airport. Couldn't the airline have sent a text or called the passengers to let us know? After spending a sleepless night at the airport, we are on our way. We have a meal and settle down to sleep. A few hours later all the cabin lights go on and the staff is serving ""lunch."" This may be the time a second meal is served on a regular flight, but after being delayed for so long it would have been nice to allow passengers to sleep, specially in business class.

You may be able to do that and you get a confirmation email too but later if you visit their website again, your booking of seats is changed.
The web site will force you to pay (which I had to do eventually) because of the seats allocated automatically were highly uncomfortable.

We did a check in the previous everning and we were informed the flight was delayed & scheduled for 13.50 in the afternoon. After reching the airport & doing the checking and all, we learnt the flight was delayed further on account of some malfunctioning of AI's computerised systems. Hence they were manually allotting seats to passengers.. No announcements was made for the delay. It resulted in a mess as there was double booking of seats and a bunch of irate passengers who wanted to be seated with their family members. The flight finally took off at 2.30 pm and reached chennai at 3.30..The second connecting flight had the same issues- manfunctioing computers & manually issued tickets. It again took another extra hour to sort out the mess as the flight was running full on both the flights .e. madhurai-chennai & chennai-mumbai.

Finally the second flight took off only at 5pm and reached Mumbai at 7pm a delay of almost 2 1/2 hours (schedulerd to arrive at 16.50 pm).

The only saving grace was that both flights , AI served decent snacks to passengers.

but the experience left a bitter taste in the mouth, I swore never to taken another AI flight in the future as I believe the malfunctioning computers is a common feature with all Air India flights.

International
Economy",Schedule - Good; Everything else - Terrible,"AI 126 on a B773 VT-ALN.

The positives first:
You cannot beat AI on scheduling if you desire a quick non-stop trip to India, all done in about 13 hours. If you are connecting to major Indian cities like Hyderabad or Bangalore or Chennai, you may even skip the notoriously crowded Delhi immigration line and transit directly to your connecting terminal after a security check. Immigration and customs can be done at your destination city. AI's strong domestic network might help if you are delayed. Unfortunately, this is the only advantage of this flight.

The bads:
Having experienced excellent in-flight service from the likes of Emirates, Etihad and even Jet Airways, I found Air India terrible.
.
First, the aircraft itself: the interiors have aged badly, very badly. At my seat 20K, I found a panel between the floor and the lower portion of the wall missing, resulting in a huge gaping dark hole, right next to me. If anything fell off your pocket into that hole, you might never get it back. The armrests were loose and filthy. The tray table, made of two flat pieces, was not flat, and the section closest to you drooped down. Good luck holding that food tray all the time if you don't want to mess your clothes. The plastic covering panels of the seat in front of me was loose and moving. My seat would not recline fully, and wouldn't come back after that little recline.

The in-flight entertainment: I just wish it wasn't there. Looked and felt like a cheap under-powered system, taking ages to register a button push. My hand remote was broken and came in two halves, but thankfully worked. I will take a cellotape with me next time. Mind you, mine was not a touch screen - you need that remote!! After browsing through the content, I realized I might not need that remote after all. External cameras did not work. In the middle of the first meal service, the entertainment system crashed. The system restarted an hour later, but they probably forgot to reload the map visualization and flight information features of the IFE. Until the very end of the flight, I didn't know where on Earth we were over, literally.

Food: Mediocre. The cheapness was apparent from the food containers, which were strong enough to be squished by babies, and covered with layers and layers of transparent plastic sheets apparently packaged by hastily showing that plastic over a candle. The tray itself was dirty. Food aesthetics was not on Air India's list, it looked as bland as the taste.

Toilets: Oh boy. There was no handwash soap, Eau De Cologne, moisturizer, or paper towels. Let me not talk about the crapper.

Crew: They did not seem to particularly enjoy doing their job. Pillows were loaded on the flight, but were not distributed!! Thankfully, my seatmate walked to the galley and got me a pillow. Crew call pings were completely ignored. If you had a window seat with two sleeping grandmas next to you, good luck getting a water bottle.

Safety: POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE - The aircraft was noisy, maybe due to that missing floor panel at my seat. Because of the noise, I couldn't make out what the crew said during their announcements. Not just me, but people in seats around me. In case of any emergency requiring an evacuation, good luck, please pray.
Others: Air India is an ailing airline. Yet, about 8 Business class revenue seats were cordoned off as a crew rest area. Dear Air India, let me give you a slightly better idea - give a couple of those seats to aircraft interior maintenance techs.

Overall: If Air India's non-stop schedules do not thrill you, and if you are generally less lucky, avoid this airline and take one of those Middle Eastern carriers. There is no fare advantage between them and Air India if you book sufficiently in advance.

PS: This review is for Air India's international sector only. My India domestic short flights with them have been generally good. The interiors of their most common A320s, food and everything else is 'usual' or 'normal'."

When asked again she said she will “reset it again” and no follow up and we didn’t it for the entire 15 hour flight. The LCD TVs and the interior shows their age, cracks in places of the plastic moldings and TV display quality definitely needs update.
Domestic route in India:
We flew Delhi Mumbai last night and asked for a blanket for my daughter and the hostess disappeared without a clue. Rang the bell again and they never showed up. This is in a flight which was one hour late to take off and ended up not able to land (again delaying)past midnight because of heavy rains in Mumbai. The food quality was good-but staffers too serious. I know there are many nice staffers out there and it will be wrong to label the entire team - but as of now I rate their service as poor based on my recent experiences."

At 34A, each time a passengers asked when was the aircraft expected to land the officials kept saying ""5 minute or 10 minutes or 5-7 minutes"". Well, the aircraft landed after 10:15 pm. The wheels took off at 10:59pm A delay of almost 2 hours!

Poor in-flight announcements. Cleanliness, food service, food quality, seat comfort were all great. Careless luggage handling. My brand new luggage was damaged.
This is one company where I believe training cannot help. The employees from pilots to cabin crew and airport staff should be replaced by young blood from elite work background.
AI will continue to sell because of the generous luggage allowance and good food may be. No in-flight entertainment - old long-haul aircraft is used for domestic flights. I value seat comfort n leg-space so AI is not bad if you can bear the delays and unprofessional attitude of AI's airport staff. Check-in staff was still ok"

Perhaps the airline should have issued new boarding cards (printed) and given them to us.

The nightmare was the return journey during which
1. there was practically scant air conditioning in the rear of the plane where we were seated.
2. the seats were creaking upon slightest of the movement
3. the rubber sheath covering some cables beneath the seats was sliding and was pretty hot. When brought to the notice of the crew we were told that this is quite normal.
4. food served was horrible.
The only thing appreciable was the exceptionally smooth landing though the braking thereafter was hard decelerating the aircraft rather too fast."

The turnaround came while coming back, Air India provide a smaller aircraft A320. A320 is a very small aircraft which is mostly used for domestic flights. Long distance flights are uncomfortable. The Air India did not inform that the return aircraft will be a smaller aircraft Nor was it mentioned when I booked the ticket. This is not the first time that they have done this.

The food looked so bad we didn’t even touch it as we did not want to get sick.
The attention of the cabin crew was so bad that even though they walked up and down the plane several times before take-off to check on seat belts, they missed the man in front of me who was on his mobile phone (!!) and continued to be on the phone as we took off and until he lost signal in the air!! This was utterly ridiculous and not to mention dangerous!

The toilets were disgusting, about acceptable in the first hour of the flight, but after 3 hours they were gross. Water (I can only hope that it was water) all over the floor and even excrement on the toilet seat in one! I had to try several before I was prepared to even go inside.

Flight AI 905 Airbus 321 from Dubai to Chennai wasn't looking pleasant to me. The plane was old and there was this constant noise i keep hearing at the emergency door on the 2nd Emergency door on the left during take off and Landing. I just hope they do something about it before we hear a plane losing its door mid-air, I don't want to IMAGINE WHAT THAT WILL TURN OUT TO BE THO""."

Business Class",Disappointed,"On entering the plane a strong whiff of stale urine assailed my nostrils and my heart sank imagining travelling for 9 hours with that stench. Thankfully the smell did permeate into the business class cabin -an immediate sense of relief overcame me.
In the old days on entering the business class cabin there would be a crew member offering a choice of either orange juice or champagne. For the last few flights this small gesture has stopped.
Once airborne in flight refreshments and the food was adequate. Nothing to write home about.
However once the meals have been served and cleared away the curtains were firmly pulled shut and I didn't see neither hide nor hair of any crew.
Generally speaking I think flights AI142 and AI143 need to improve considerably to remain competitive.
I would imagine most of the Business Class passengers are employed by the Indian Government so travel free.
I am currently planning my 2018 winter break and looking at flights by alternative airlines.
Shame really as I used to enjoy flying Air India Executive Class."

It took me almost 1.5 hrs to do the check-in. After boarding the flight we have been informed due to technical problems with the aircraft it wont leave.which has caused a delay of almost 3 hrs . we were just sitting at the aircraft for almost an hour and none of the crew has even bothered to offer water. Post disembarkation from the aircraft we were shifted to new aircraft however in the whole process air india didn't even offered any compensation, food vouchers to the pax. Flight condition is pretty bad the USB port was broken, TV screens were not working properly.. headset has issues. Overall a poor expeirence"

Economy",A tale of two cities and two airlines,"My wife, daughter and I had booked a (fantastic) tour of Shimla followed by visits to Agra and Jaipur from 31st May-8th June 2018. We decided to book an outbound flight to Delhi from Bangalore with Air India (and the return flight with Jet Air) in order to fit our itinerary.This was our first experience of flying with Air India.

We had no problem whatsoever with the advance check-in. The Nanhanda Regent hotel manager in Bangalore kindly printed our boarding passes so we were able to choose seats together. We had a lot of heavy luggage that we did not want to take with us on the tour so we were delighted to find a left luggage office at Banagalore airport for collection on our return.

The service and the evening meal served by Air India was excellent, chosen from a wide range of options to suit all palates and diets. We arrived in good time at Delhi airport for our night-time travel to Shimla, arriving early the following morning."

AI 336 and while going back to Chandigarh from Bangkok it becomes AI 337. Both ways it takes 4 hours &10 minutes. It took off at 5.50 AM from Suvarnabhumi Airport BKK and passes over Calcutta, after 2.30 Hrs. After about 40 minutes the take off for next 2 hrs. it suffered extreme turbulence and the plane was having jumping like spring doll everybody was extremely scared, and the clouds outside the window were dark and no visibility at all for two hours.Captain announced that crew to sit and leave the breakfast and coffee service and asked everybody to fasten their seat belt. May be in June that part of the globe has dense fog and black clouds, some passengers were suggesting emergency landing. After 2 hrs captain announced to start service and resume coffee.He also said we are above Kolkata now and sky was clear now and that we will now fly above Durgapur, Banaras,Delhi. But such experience for a long period of 2 hrs was really scary for everybody felt so. Once there was a jump of 10 ft high, what a scary shock it was. Co-pessenger next to me sweared to not to fly again.
But google says turbulence has not caused a crashed in last 40 to 50 years, thank God."

Since it takes off at 21.50 and reaches by 22.30 you can finish your work in Kochi and be home to sleep over. But the flight is regularly late. Moreover it comes at the International Terminal. Even though the terminal is new and convenient one has to go through all formalities of International flight. It also lands on the International Terminal in Trivandrum. Since the Airport is close to the City and the traffic is light in the late evening it is not much of a problem
