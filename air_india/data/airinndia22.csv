Staff wasn't helpful. We didn't get offered any water/drinks/snacks although they promised this as compensation. A lot of passengers missed their connecting flights and the airline didn't even apologize for the delays, which is unacceptable."

Food is the main draw. Tasty mild curries, breakfasts and extras such as cake and cookies during the flight! Normally plane food makes me slightly nauseous but this was great! Good polite cabin crew and felt safe. Will continue to fly Air India."

International

This obviously doesn't fill us with the most confidence as surely an announcement to the rest of the passengers eagerly waiting would have been the most professional way to deal with the matter?!

We eventually board the plane and sit down in what can only be described as outdated chairs with the internal cabin in drastic need of updating. I think to myself ok well at least I can watch a film and relax right?.... Wrong! The whole plane entertainment panels are down (guessing this was the problem), nothing was announced by the pilot or flight cabin crew regarding this matter, I asked an air hostess who just said to me ""all off"" and continued on.

Next comes the food... I was asleep trying to avoid jet lag by adjusting to local Kathmandu time as was my wife, we both had ear plugs in and shut out masks, but this didn't stop the air hostess from waking us and asking if we want ""veg or meat"", I asked for meat and got veg I was too tired to argue so just eat it.

Normally when disembarking the aircraft the flight attendants will normally smile and wish us well on our onward journey, but as we walked past they were ignoring us and starting to clean the cabin...

I chose this flight purely by price, and as my mother taught me when I was younger ""you get what you pay for"".

I would never travel with air India again and would advise all friends and fellow readers here to avoid like the plague."

If so, it shall appear clearly at their own as well as other web sites while booking that web check in not possible.

Mind you this is a 14 hour flight and theses restrooms get a lot of use. Both legs of my trip at least one restroom was out of order entirely. This is unacceptable.. Both times the restrooms next to wear the flight attendants stayed were conveniently ""out of order"" as well.
In the row I was in 2 of the 3 remotes didn't work - the volume up and down buttons were literally missing on one of the remotes renduring it useless. I would have been totally screwed if I wasn't the only one in the row. - no TV for 14 hours !!!!

However apart from my purpose being served for a non stop journey, there wasn't much too offer for a business class passenger. Lounge was shared and menu options were limited for this airline. Heard lounge will be better soon as terminal will change. On boarding, it is an Indian tradition when someone is your guest then you serve some water or drinks soon. Noticed that wasn't asked on that day till you requested. The food service and quality could be far better. The seating space was good and seat was flat, but not all worked same way, not my next seat at least. The service overall looked unplanned and sloppy. The worst point of this flight was middle rows being curtained off with crew sleeping. I had read about it but now even experienced it. Looked very unpolished and ugly and major turn off. Probably those seats can easily be sold and revenues earned with alternate arrangements for crew to rest without compromising on quality and convenience. That space can also be put to better use like private cabins. Observed some more issues since I travel on business class on other airlines, so the difference was noticeable. Overall much can be improved. If non stop is not so important, then other airlines would be better option for business class."

I nearly missed my flight but both desk staff and security staff made sure i was in plane on time. Although I was travelling Economy class and was almost pissed off with my last Air India flight from Melbourne to Delhi and was very conscious about this flight.
But the moment i entered into plane, the staff was so helpful that they offered me a hand towel, moisturiser and a deodorant as i was sweating badly after running for almost 5 minutes to catch my almost missed flight.
Food was excellent, in-flight entrainment was excellent but it was the service that made the difference. For a moment i thought i am travelling with Emirates or Singapore.
My question is why can't Air India keep the same standards in every route.
I guess it depends on flight manager and clearly we got some bad apples in other AI operated flights.

First, self-service machines were not accepting Air India flight number; then we were directed to go through Migration since we were leaving European area. More than 100 pax had piled up there, with only ONE officer attending. Tension whether we would catch connecting AI flight on time, since we had already come in 30 min. late from original destination (by KLM).
Also tension because without boarding pass we might not clear Immigration. Pax had to have at lease something written about onward confirmed journey!
With that cleared, finally, we still had no boarding pass and there was NOBODY around to guide us. Instead, we were directed to a bus to go for other terminal; again tension about catching flight on time.
At other terminal nobody from airline around (or any other airport person for that matter), we had to find our own way to AI counter. There only our boarding passes were handed over.
Announcements were inaudible and in bad English (French speaking staff...)

That flight also left later than scheduled.
Plane itself, Dreamliner Boeing, was comfortable enough; food ok, and staff all right. And we landed on time!"

The only thing I really liked was, how the pilot handled the aircraft very well. The pilots on both trip to and from India were really great. The take off and landing were very smooth and even in bad weather, they managed to give us a smooth ride. Thumbs up to the pilots. The rest are just so-so. The seats were very uncomfortable, not well padded and some armchairs doesn't lift up at all. They also have small leg rooms , the guy in front of me reclined his seat and it a few inches away from chest already so I need to recline my seat too just to have enough space from the seat in front of me. The aircraft is also dirty, in between seats, you will see the dirt and the staff doesn't even bother to clean up or pick up whatever people drop to the floor. Most of the people also rode on that airline don't know how to maintain cleanliness especially in their restrooms. Restrooms are so filthy. Stickers on the wall, tissues and trash all over the restroom. Staff also doesn't even bother to clean up or refill the supplies in the restroom. The food? Well what do you expect, a low class Indian food they serve. Bland breakfast, too strong curries for lunch and dinner. Their breads are cold and hard. The coffee is like a tablespoon of instant coffee mixed with 1 liter of hot water. Most of the tv/ entertainment monitors were also broken. Their utensils and headsets are noticeable recycled. Most of us from the tour group did not even bother to eat or touch the food that they serve, we just slept all the time. Two stars for the pilots but for the rest of the service are thumbs down."

Lost baggage at Delhi - a further 3 hr wait there to work out how to cope with our situation. No flight to Cochin for 12 hrs. An abysmal hotel found for us in city- noisy, dirty, uncomfortable. Back to airport - promised flight a further 1 hr delay. Get to Cochin midnight and to our hotel by 3 a.m. (approx 32 hrs without any real sleep). Lost a day in a very expensive hotel.
All this can happen, I know - but there is never usually any quibble about communication and/or compensation - but here's the rub: I defy anyone here being ab;e to contact Air India by any means other than perhaps a lucky physical voit to their HQ in London. They seem to not exist in anything other than name.

Well the Air hostess (female) looked at you as though to say they are way above us and that we were an inconvenience. Not once did they smile or make you feel welcome. It was as though they were some Bollywood actress and they were God’s gift to everyone on this Earth! A simple thing like asking for water so that my mum could take her meds was a lot to ask. “I will bring it to you once I have 2 mins” and I was standing at the galley so I could have taken it myself.

Now me being Indian myself should take the utmost pride in my motherland airline.

And then at 4.30 (rain had stopped, just that weather was slightly cloudy), they said flight is cancelled....the manager was a cunning lady and she gave 2 options - 1) we go back to guwahati and they will arrange for a flight next day, but we will have to arrange for accommodation 2) they will give us accommodation in Shillong and then next day morning carry us to Guwahati and help with a flight. It will take 2-3 hours to find accommodation in Shillong as all hotels are booked and next day morning they will start at 5a.m. She also said that not everyone can be accommodated in next day's flight and it will be FCFS basis!! WOW....this is the pathetic nature of the airline....no food no accomodation no rescheduled flight!! Finally we decided not to trust this wicked witch and went to Guwahati and stayed there for that night paying from our pocket. Then next day when we went to Guwahati Air India ticket counter, they refused to have any agreement/discussion with Shillong Air India authorities and they said they can't accommodate any one of us as the flight is full!!

It was just like a local bus. But the customer service was good inside the flight and check in process was also done smoothly. If your travel hours is very long then this is not recommended. Only thing I liked about the airlines is the cabin staff service inside flight.

The ground staff as well as crew is not at all professional. I chose 35 C seat and recliner for the same was not working. In flight entertainment is poor. Good in food service but at the same time very poor in hospitality. Air India need to train their crew members and air hostess with basic hospitality first. They also need to check their basic services such as inflight entertainment, headphones etc.

Overall, if you don't have any option then only choose Air India."

I am currently sitting in Delhi, in borrowed clothes and have already been shopping to buy some undies and bras because Air India failed to deliver my luggage on time. Three days since I got here and I'm still waiting on my luggage.

This would not be such a big issue if they had communicated the timeframe etc correctly but there has been no communication so far.
Multiple (I am talking about over 30 calls in three days) and still no updates.

Air India has a really poor customer care, service on flight and the ground staff do not know how to communicate properly. The halt in Sydney was also poorly organised, flight delays and now delayed baggage. Once I receive my baggage, the worry shifts to the flight back home.

1. air india connecting flight from Mumbai to Delhi cancelled
2. no announcement and the flight was completely removed from the departures board, thinking I had missed the flight
3. spoke to air india customer service desk at the gate who was very rude and un-helpful, just said its the next flight. I tried to query why the departure board did not state cancelled he gave no response. If he hates his job why work there.
3. finally plane departed 1 hour 30 mins late, arrived at Delhi airport expecting a fast transfer to reach my connecting flight which was due to take off in 45 mins. Instead they rounded up all passengers mad eus collect our luggage and explained you can either fly to another UK airport (Heathrow) and make your own way home or take the next flight to Birmingham the following day.
4. requested for next available flight on another airline as airline fault for delay, did not agree.
5. agreed to stay extra night and take next available flight, waited 2 hours for them to arrange a hotel and transport to said hotel and advised they would cover costs.
6. arrived at hotel (Hotel Taurus) believing this would be a good airport hotel, how wrong I was. Arrived at hotel was dirty and smelly. Refused to stay and took provided taxi back to airport.
7. Paid for taxi there and back with no refund.
8. Complained about service with airindia desk, who after 5 minutes seemed to get bored and talk between themselves. Asked to speak to manager who was not helpful. They said I was given wrong information they do not cover taxi costs. They advised would send me to another hotel.
10. requested for name and number of complaints, was unhappy with this and was very reluctant to give this details and was quite offensive when he actually did so.
11. Hotel (Hotel Le Seasons)was maybe a 2 star, the room was small and not well looked after, crack in wall, bed was quite hard, however was much cleaner than previous so thought would stay one night.
12. next day lost my phone at airport upon realising when boarding plane, said there was nothing they could do and they would not check the lost and found or radio/call them. They advised me to take my seat and would give further details during flight.
13. during flight advised to contact airindia at Birmingham airport and nothing they could do. Gave me a bunch of details, so asked for them to write it down, and said 'Well I've just told you why do you need to written down'.
14 got to Birmingham located airindia desk, person was much more polite but still didnt have a resolution, gave me contact for Delhi lost and found.
15 contacted Delhi lost and found, advised that airline (airindia) can retrieve this for you.
16 contacted airindia again, providing all details delhi airport advised, response was that we have never done this before (no one has ever forgot or lost property at an airport - hard to believe) and they would look into
17 have been chasing for a response/update however response of emails requesting same info already sent and no actually resolution.
18 still chasing a update 2 weeks after raising this, no reply every time I am contacting them to try to get a response or confirmation they have received my email.

To sum up - The customer service was extremely poor, very unhelpful and unwilling to listen to me. Gave me 2 options take hotel or wait 12 hours for next flight. I would never travel with this airline. Also damaged my suitcase by putting a hole the size of a 10 pence coin."

I recently traveled from US to India via Air India. I had never traveled by Air India as I had heard so many horrible experiences from others. But since my wife insisted that it is not that bad, I took a chance. And this is how regretful it was: On our arrival at Delhi, we found one of our bags worth INR 9000 (almost 1 year old, originally in perfect condition) to be completely damaged, full of long cracks. Since we had to take a connection to Pune, we asked the official at Delhi airport if we could file a damaged bag report at Pune airport - they agreed. So on arriving at Pune, after about an hour of formalities (this is after 24 hours of travel), we were able to file a report. The complaint was file on paper (not online on a computer!). We were told verbally that the expected amount we would receive was around INR 5500 and were even introduced to the person who would drop the cheque at our home within a week and collect the damaged bag. We waited and waited and waited - several calls to the Pune airport office over several weeks went useless. So I had to write an email copying several officials from Air India. That is when I received a call from Air India Pune office that they were in the process of finalizing and I could expect INR 6500 reimbursement towards the damaged bag. After this call, again there was a long silence. After a couple of weeks, I was informed that the decided amount was INR 4500. I obviously objected. And so the appeal process began, which I am pretty sure did not actually happen. After a couple of weeks, again I received a call from Pune airport office that the amount is still INR 4500 post-appeal. And now came another surprise - I was asked to come to Air India Pune office to collect the cheque and carry the damaged bag along! Whatever happened to the person who was supposed to drop the cheque at my home and collect the damaged bag!!??

Overall damaged bag case handling duration: 45+ days

Please note that this behavior is absolutely in line with my original expectations as I have never had ANY expectations whatsoever from a pathetic airlines that they are. And they proved it that I was right :)

Also, the airplane we took from Chicago to Delhi had big cracks on the back of almost ALL the seats. I wonder who is maintaining those airplanes, if at all!"

I faced only when travelling in Domestic - The flights are always delayed any where between 3-5 hours but the food and beverages will be good.

My advice is please do not shout or abuse the front desk or gate staff during the flight delay. because they dint have any authority on the flights operations."

Now this is a time to appreciate & recognize that this airline has very well improved greatly its services in recent months. I seen that well experience & well manage (no early retirement age) for air cabin crew, so you can be served by a friendly granny! Very much Punctuality & better seats standard as compare to the new private airlines. Other Airlines will charge for extra baggage over and above a miserly 15kg allowance, they will charge for a window or AISLE seat, for food etc. and still you will not get any legroom at all. ! With Air India you get a 25kg allowance, more legroom, a full service (Free food is very good) tea and Coffee, and the flights are much better regarding punctuality these days. Full off entertainment kits with headphone & Tab. So you can enjoy many hit movies, Music, Serials and many more without any interruption. They very much take care to senior citizens & handicapped people. They guide new people who fly first time! No any cabin crew behave as rude with any passenger. There was no any attitude on face and the airline is definitely more professional. So I like to fly with this airline."

Its a government run enterprise so didn't had high hopes. Earlier I have traveled on Indigo, Go Air and Jet so after my flight landed in Mumbai, I was surprised with the overall experience despite the prejudice.

The high point of the flight was the food non come close to Air India in domestic front and the leg room which to be honest was much better on two of the three I travel on. Only Jet could come closer to Air India on that front.

The only scary moment was the landing experience it was quite bumpy and gave many on board some serious scare. But overall a very good experience. Wasn't carrying much luggage so can say much about that but everything went smoothly for me. Will definitely recommend Air India."

I was told that I should have applied for the visa weeks ago to simply be in the airport. This goes completely against all other advice i have read or been told about Indian visas! I was only going ot be in the country for two hours before my flight home but was told i needed a visa for this. The airline should have told me at the time of booking that I wouldn't be able to use the flight without a visa (if that even is the case, i'm still sceptical) thus I couldn't use the next two parts of my flight home to Hanoi so wasted a lot of money and had to buy new flights. The airline staff on the desk were incredibly unhelpful when i was clearly upset and in shock about the situation. They said unless i had CASH to buy a new flight they could do nothing for me and were incredibly dismissive. I will never go near this airline again. AVOID"

I was fortunate to have been given an exit row seat ( row 30 on the Dreamliner) which is adjacent to the mid cabin toilets. The passengers ( mainly Indian nationals) had no idea how to open or close and lock the toilet doors. The seats weren't as comfortable as the Airline blurb suggests however the cabin was quieter than on most larger long haul aircraft. The cabin crew service was adequate, the food was basically very ordinary. Would I fly Air India by choice again, definitely not, this ticket was booked for me by my hosts in India."

Hostess has to learn more polite and in attention with at least with business class passengers as in case of Singapore airline, jet airways, Cathy Pacific and Malaysian airways.

Punctuality although better is not yet up to the standard of the new private airlines,but most importantly the fleet urgently needs up upgrading , many of their Airbus 320 aircraft are more than 20 years old .

So what the advantages?

Don't look at the headline figures of some of the private airlines . They will charge for extra baggage over and above a miserly 15kg allowance, they will charge for a window or aisle seat,, for food ,and you will not get any legroom at all,

With Air India you get a 25kg allowance, more legroom, a full service ( and the food is quite good) tea and coffee , and the filghts are much better regarding punctuality these days. The couldn't care less , what do you expect if you fly with us? attitude has gone and the airline is definitely more professional ,

Often this all combines for a more comfortable flight all round."

The aircraft was again neat, clean and bright, good seats too. But they made us sit for almost an hour after boarding. It would have been nice if the flight commander or one of the attendants made an announcement with a soft apology. Ultimately before taking off a few irate passengers gathered up in front in angry voices and demanding a reason for the delay.... I though they would disrupt the flight to an extent that we would have to de-board. Fortunately we took off and it was clockwork from there on."
