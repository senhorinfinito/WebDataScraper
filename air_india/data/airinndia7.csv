after that 15 min delay everything improved. flew on a Dreamliner.
excellent well maintained aircraft. menu was superb. ancillaries toilet amenities right up there. a surprisingly good bar cart, and cheese selection. the flight attendant were a bit more mature(sic!), but well informed and friendly and a tad compassionate.

definitely recommend the business class product"

My pillow had hair all over it and looked like someone had slept on it on the previous flight. I asked the attendant to bring me a clean fresh pillow and he brought me another pillow that was in the same condition. The seat did not flatten out and it was very uncomfortable sleeping. No menu, food was awful and very spicy. The whole plane smelled like a curry wagon. My tray was broken and had to put a pillow under it for support. Staff was accommodating their friends in business who otherwise were traveling economy.

One of our friend couple had only single entry Schengen Visa but the airline staff made it possible for them to re-enter and have room else they would had to stay at the airport itself. Next day the staff re-scheduled our connecting flight from Delhi to Indore (our final destination). I was informed by the hotel receptionist that in his 3 years at the same hotel, this was for the 1st time that Air India had to accommodate their passengers at the hotel.

Did not pay close enough attention to their specifications which is my fault). They told me as I was boarding that my bag was detained and had to go through clearance. They would not give me any more information and ushered me onto the flight. When I got in, I had to go through a long process of ‘requesting my baggage be cleared’ - they told me it would be in the next day because there were no more flights that day. (Why they could not have originally just taken out the battery when checking my bag the first time is beyond me). I call the next day - it is still being processed, it will be in tomorrow. No apology, no explanation, nothing. The next day, the same thing. I have yet to receive my bag, my trip is now delayed (flights canceled, plans changed) because they will not release my bag. It is a battery charger, my bag is easily packed, it should have been removed within minutes and sent along to me.

Hence i chose Air India, since it is a Star Alliance member and it would benefit me as a Gold card member of Star Alliance (Lufthansa).

Check-in was smooth - at a dedicated Star Alliance Gold counter and i was provided with a lounge card to the GVK East lounge. It's an excellent lounge and has great food.

Boarding was also smooth.

Unfortunately, the cabin was warm upon boarding and it became worse with all passengers finally seated in place. The cabin crew gave all possible excuses oh high temperature, humidity, ""as soon as we take off it will become fine...."", etc.

The cabin crew let's the entire airline down in my opinion. They are full of excuses and probably have been trained to say these things to avoid handling these situations in a better way.

Although i had received a Priority tag on my bag, it arrived almost last on the baggage belt ! So, basically there was no priority baggage handling.

Overall, it is the only Indian carrier with such a good connectivity network, but with a very very average service."

I was booked on an evening flight to Chennai and the Air India one was the most convenient time. When I got on board I was immediately struck by a deep red twisty designed carpet I last saw the Like of on a film where people used words like ‘groovy daddy-o’ and had people like Telly Savalas in it when they were young.

I then saw the Business Class seats, a deep (from aged dirt) yellow and gold diamond pattern with a beige (once darker brown) leather headrests. I sat down and to my surprise they were quite comfy...most of the spring in them went years ago I imagine.

The air stewards were great and really helpful although there was a problem with some of the lights in the cabin and after trying to fix it using their control screen in the gantry one of the stewards resorted to whacking the light in the cabin repeatedly much to the bemusement of the passengers. Sadly, hitting it didn’t work so it got left not working.

When the food came out it was amazing, well amazingly bad. A carrot salad sandwich with no crusts and a piece of fruit cake, with one piece of fruit in it. All kept fresh under thick high tensile cellophane.

The flight itself was ok, just great fun to watch the Steward who clearly modelled himself on the Fonz from Happy Days (well we were temporarily back in the 70’s) and was soooo smooth in everything he did. He checked his hair more often than he checked if we had our seatbelts on, but he was harmless enough.

All in all a fab and wayout experience, next time, I might just leave the office a bit earlier..."

The flight leaving Kathmandu was 2 hrs late (that happens very often with them, I heard), and not because of bad weather. When we got to New Delhi, 30 minutes before the plane leaves to Colombo in the same terminal, they told us “you missed your plane” in a way like it was my fault. We were 12 in the same situation. I think we could have made it to the other plane, but let’s say we couldn’t. 3 different agents of Air India told us 3 different things in 2 minutes of where to go. We waited to have somebody rebook us on the next flight and for the food and the hotel, as it was already too late to get a flight on the same day. They told us many times “yes, yes, somebody will take care of rebooking you, wait”. When someone from Sri Lankan airline finally came, he said he was waiting for a confirmation from Colombo (at 8 pm in the night ??). Anyways, this part might not be Air India’s fault.
We finally got our ticket for the next morning flight (boarding at 4h30 am) after more than 3 hours without food or water.
We then had to wait again more than an hour to get the vouchers for the hotel and the food. The hotel is inside the terminal at New Delhi. When we got there we still couldn’t get internet because they were waiting for Air India for the vouchers. No room, no internet. My boyfriend was so pissed that he went back in the terminal to find an Air India agent. It took him more than an hour to find an Air India agent in New Delhi airport who just said “the vouchers are there, there’s nothing I can do”. (When he got back, i just started checking in). The hotel and the meal where ok except that it took me 5 times walking all the way to my room to the reception to have it open. The card keys just didn’t work and they just kept giving me another key which didn’t work. There was no breakfast. So if you have a connection with less than 3 hours with Air India, I suggest you think twice before booking that flight. For Air India, I would have appreciated to have an internet connection (the one in New Delhi airport doesn’t work in international phones and the roaming didn’t work) while you are rebooking us, and faster rebooking and faster communication with the hotel for the vouchers. And I guess I would have appreciated to have a bottle of water or something to have me wait...
It is possible to make a delayed flight a pleasant experience (it happened with air New Zealand; they waited for me out of the plane with my new boarding pass and 100$ Australians and somebody who took care of everything in 5 minutes)."

Was relaxing in the Business Lounge of Air India post check in and security at 5 am, when suddenly the duty attendant announced the boarding of AI 435. A bit surprised I trudged to gate no 42C, which was a long way off. I was amongst the last few passengers to board the bus to the aircraft. I boarded the bus at 5:20 am and awaited the move to the aircraft. The bus waited outside the gate for a period of almost 25 minutes for the balance passengers (only two passengers finally boarded the bus at 5:43 am). The ac of the bus was not working and the driver did not even switch on the fans. When asked as to why, he rudely said ""Subah ka time hai"".

The return flight departed at 3 pm for Delhi which was experiencing an horrific dust storm. The plane was held waiting for landing conditions to improve and eventually made an attempt to land but needed to abort from a very low altitude. Rather than diverting to another airport the plane after further holding made another attempt to land with passengers petrified and physically ill. This too was aborted and by now passengers were in extreme fear. Eventually the plane was diverted as fuel levels were low. While refuelling and aircraft cleaning anarchy was developing amongst a number of passengers who were demanding that they be allowed to leave the aircraft. The airline staff failed to take a strong position and ongoing debate further delayed our flight continuation.
Once the flight resumed the attendants did little to support the passengers and ensure appropriate flight standards. Their lack of supervision had seats not returned to upright and electronic devices on at takeoff.
The flight finally landed safely at Delhi airport shortly before midnight.

We were traveling overseas and our return flight was to land in Delhi. We had to take a connecting flight to Mumbai. Knowing that there can be delays and uncertainty of time taken at immigration etc., I had kept a safe cushion and booked us on the 2100 Air India flight from Delhi to Mumbai.
Luckily our international flight was ahead of time and immigration was double quick, so we were done by 1700…which left us with a four hour wait at Delhi airport. We tried getting an earlier flight to Mumbai and spoke to just about everyone in Air India at the international airport to put us on any earlier flight (which there were enough of). We were willing to pay the fee for ticket change.. but end of the day the result was nada and we ended up wasting 4 hours at the airport and taking our scheduled 2100 flight that (as expected) landed late in Mumbai etc. etc.

Now, I fully appreciate that they were well within their rights to not do the ticket change but I have two points:
1) During my management course we were taught that a flight seat (apart from a hotel room) is the most perishable of commodities. So a if a customer is asking for an earlier flight (and you have seats available) why would you not make that sale and have the option of selling the three extra seats that are now available for the later flight?
2) While there can be ten reasons for NOT changing the flight for a customer, could no one in Air India find ONE reason to actually do it??

I was not disgruntled, just disappointed at the attitude. Also made it clear to me as to why the enterprise is in the state that it is in and is up for sale… they have simply not come to terms with the changing scenario and continued to operate in their old, dated ways.
Sad…but true!"

Earlier there was another Airline also known as Indian Airlines, which used to look after the domestic needs of the country. Even when there were no private Airlines, only Indian Airlines used to ply on the domestic routes. However, Air India used to carry passengers from International Airports to International Airports within the country in the late nights. Once there was a government order that the government officers would only fly by Indian Airlines and the Air India. These are the antique pieces of information which the young generation might not know. I remember to have travelled from Ranchi to Patna with a fare of Rs.240/- only in 1984 by Indian Airlines.
Oh! I am to review my journey from New Delhi to Indore. The official Airline has prime locations at the Airport in Terminal 3 and boasts of best services. I had to wait hardly for about 15 minutes to get my boarding pass and the seat was allotted only in the 17th row in spite of my repeated requests. This is the problem with this Airline. The front rows are kept vacant for the Parliamentarian's and high official's requisitions till the last time and even the early birds are allotted the last rows. This is though objectionable, but this government Airline cannot afford to ignore the VVIPs requests who are forced to travel on short notices. So I travelled by sitting in the 17th row.
The security as usual takes some time in spite of the best efficiency of the CISF, and then I reached the Air India gate. Because after missing a few flights now I reach always before 2 hours so I need some reading material. The waiting was made less tiring by my mobile. Whenever I have to sit at the Airports I read my pending mails in the mobile, because that is the only time when I can concentrate on my own thoughts. So I boarded the plane after waiting for about 80 minutes which was on time.
The crew in Air India are not that young due to the personnel policy of this government Airline, so apparently they are also not very dedicated to their jobs as you find in the private Airlines. The Air India always serves food on board by charging bills in the tickets itself. Though the food was not enough, but because it was the lunch time so I had to grub something. Normally the taste of food of Air India is always better than others, so it was good this time also. But by the time we finished our food the turbulence started and it continued till the time of landing at Indore Airport. The pilots were experienced, so the flight landed with a little jerk and we made a move to collect our bags after using the bus facility. The bags did not keep us waiting and we finally came out of the Indore Airport. This was my first visit after March 2008 to Indore, but much had changed at the Airport and the town in itself as it has been ranked first in cleanliness in the country, so that effect was visible at the Airport also, thanks to the authorities.
So I can say that this was a comfortable flight in a government Airline. All the very best to them."

The flight attendant that was serving the right hand side of the economy row facing the plane was a mere piece of cattle that was being forced to work against her will, well at least that’s the impression that me and my family members got along with others on that section. My sister was given a seat with no onboard entertainment for a flight that lasted approximately 8 hours. She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row “be careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replace”. Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other oriental looking air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break. These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome. A demand for change of seats was declined too. This airline is by far a third world airline proving true to its roots. The concept of customer service is a mere myth to this establishment. If you value your custom and value for money my strong recommendation is seek alternative airlines and stay away from this airline. I regret flying with air India and will never do so in the future."

Once the plane the flight was unremarkable except Air India's flight manual appears quite different from most US carriers - they put down flaps and gear 15 minutes before touchdown! If you want to fly internally in India, there's no avoiding Air India, so like with many things, you suck it up and go with it.

Other than the money the actual flight was disgraceful. They threw camphor all over the bathroom floors to cover the smell, which just made it worse. The poor flight attendants in their polyester uniforms had such bad body odour after a 12 hour flight it was nauseating being near them.

While waiting for luggage delivery, we checked the time, to notice that it took us one hour to receive our suitcase.

This time we were travelling from New Delhi to Indore, and the flight was well in time and the boarding took place in a seamless manner. What was better was the fact that Gate Number 31 was assigned for this flight which is towards the beginning on the colossal Terminal 3 of IGI Airport. Further, hydraulic aero bridge was connected to the aircraft which saved our time substantially.

But yes, Air India aircraft cleaning officials should stay more alert and vigilant as a mid-sized insect travelled with us from New Delhi to Indore and was going to Mumbai from there. It stayed glued to the window as it might be experiencing the beauty of the skies for the first time or it might be in a state of shock. I could not comprehend its expressions as it was completely still and static, but I must say that the officials responsible for the cleaning of the aircrafts' must stay more cautious as it does not reflect a great impression.

Everyone on board was also able to have a row of seats to themselves, and the drinks after meal service was self-serve. Wine / whisky and soft drinks were available along with beer.

The return flight from Delhi to London Heathrow was a full flight, and the service was not very good. We only received one meal during the 9 hour flight and the air hostesses seemed to be more interested in eating their meals at the back of the plane than serving anyone on board.

I never sleep on a flight but for some very strange reason I fell asleep straight after dinner and had to be woken up just before landing. From Delhi's International airport, I had to connect to a domestic flight immediately and it was while going through security there I noticed that the Tablet had been removed from my bag. Ground staff checked the plane and of course it hadn't been left behind, it had been stolen
I do not hold air India responsible but they refused to acknowledge my concern and need to report the incident to an official for Insurance purposes. I was directed from Delhi to Jodhpur ground staff however there was absolutely no one at all at Jodhpur Airport. I went to the Air India office in Jodhpur the next day ,they were not interested and referred me .back to Delhi. Once back in Delhi 4 weeks later Delhi Staff said I should raise it with Birmingham since that was my point of origin. Needless to say that was fruitless too.

During my flight AI 131 from Mumbai to London I had an amazing experience and the staff was so pleasant especially the one lady whose name was Nisha. She was exceptionally good and served with a smile throughout the nine hours of the flight.

However, during my return flight from London to Mumbai the staff was terrible they were talking to the passengers very rudely, the service was just mechanical and there was no personal touch. At one point I was so upset that I walked up to the rear of the plane and ask for the names and told them that i wanted to give feedback. One crew member, a if you gentleman who is appeared to be in early 50s asked me whether that the review was going to be good or bad. I said it’s going to be bad. He said please go to your seat and I’ll come and give you the names and as I expected he never came up to give the names.
