Food is part of the ticket so one saves money in this regard else other airline charge you even for a bottle of water!

Staff is helpful and Airline is good. Except for their change in the tags i did not face any issue. The previous tags were much better the new ones which are like stickers suck as they keep on going out so the solution provided by police staff was another company tag.

Air India, I miss those tag which had a band and could be tied they were really awesome...hope you have got those back!"

Air India, nowadays uses the dreamliner which is an amazing flight in terms of all the on-board amenties and services. In this section i would rate it even higher than Singapore Airlines ...
Air India is miserable and worst when it comes to punctuality and ground/counter interfaces.
Travelling with Air India always comes with a risk of flight delays and/or cancellations..So be prepared...
Regarding the cost of tickets, thats not a catch anymore because the price of tickets with Air India have gone considerably up after Air India joined the Star Alliance club and the introduction of Dreamliner."

Nothing more that you can expect from a 1 hour flying flight. I loved the breakfast served on the flight. It had Mendu Wada, Upma, cut fruits, croissants, butter & jam and tea / coffee. Wet tissue was refreshing. I did not have check in luggage so not sure if the luggage arrived on time."

Air India caused us to have yo pay for an extra night an hotel in Delhi Airport but we're not going to compensate us. The third flight we had was in an aircraft which was filthy, and overhead luggage lockers were held together with Duct Tape. The crew were scruffy with stained clothes. We also had at least four security checks, the last being at the bottom of the aircraft steps when boarding."

I was flying on this Dreamliner...as they call it. Few hours after the take off and meal finished...the cabins were dark. The dreamliner do not have windows which you can shut down or open. They have these LED lights which you can control and so can the crew.
As soon as the food was over , the crew darkened the cabins though each window has its own control. And when asked they said passengers want to sleep. same on their return flight too. this trip was done in november 2015. Imagine a long flight of 12 plus hours and most of the time...it is dark. Unfortunately , i was not near the window and was felling discomfort and bit of suffocation due to the darkness...claustrophobic. Informed the crew...but they did not seem to be bothered. Also to say...it seemed to be a self service flight....as when I asked an air hostess to get me a glass of water as was very uneasy...she very rudely said that go help yourself at the back of the aircraft. On complaining to another hostess and asking her to call the supervisor...I was told that the supervisor was busy. I waited thinking once free she would come and talk...but no response or no help. I was feeling even more sick and told the crew am fnding it difficult to breathe to which she replied that maybe we can give you an oxygen bottle, Thats it....such a care a damn attitude...from the airline which I have been loyal to for years...even when my friends and colleagues used to laugh on my loyalty. But now i understand my friends...
On the return flight same darkening of the cabin.
On asking was told passengers want to sleep. on telling them that whoever needs to sleep would darken his window as it could be self ontrolled to which the staff said that you could do it. Again not being near the window, I requested my co passenger to brighten the window,. inspite of trying many times....it could not so asked the crew have they centrally locked it so that it could remain dark and less work for them. On a day flgiht why would the passengers feel sleepy? Asked her to check and she did and came and said yes by mistake it got locked. was it really a mistake or is it to save them being disturbed or made to work.
On arriving in India...i sent my complain to Customer services and its Feb now....but no reply.
Thats the Dreamliner...anything but a Dream.....can be a nightmare. think twice....!"

It was not a pleasant experience. I being a frequent flyer, my observation is that there is considerable improvement in maintaining time but with experience of this type - in my experience - 20% of flights get delayed. My return journey was also delayed by about 30 minutes on 4th Beb."

On the afternoon before I received both sms and email that our departure time had changed and that I should contact Air India to have tickets re-issued which seemed strange as the flight number had not changed. The woman on the help line had no idea that the flight had been changed and when she tried to re-book me 5 days later I just told her to forget about it and take my chances at the airport.
Check-in was the usual disorganised queuing you find all over India. We went through security at Amritsar airport and found that we had not been assigned a gate. All flights out of Amritsar were delayed but AI was the only airline that did NOT make any announcement at all. Spicejet and Jet airways constanty updated their customers. When our flight was delayed by more than 30 minutes I went to find a staff member only to realise there was none available and the only way this would be possible would be to exit the gate area and enter the check in again, looking at the queues I was not prepared to risk joining security again. Eventually we saw our plane land and followed the masses to our gate (no announcement). I asked the woman as boarding if we would miss our connecting flight, she looked it up and said it is also delayed in Delhi and there would be no problem.
The flight to Delhi was very good - plane was modern with great entertainment.
At Dehi, pure chaos. Staff waiting as we disembarked screaming at everyone about connecting flights. I heard Cochin followed and was told to run to gate as flight was departing on time (apparently this was the only AI flight that actually departed Delhi on time that day - my bad luck again). Then they changed their minds and said we will wait for the other passengers also connecting. We all gathered and begun to head to gate when another staff member came over and said they had changed their mind and would not let us board.
More chaos as staff at transfers desk could not find out what alternative flights were available! I have never seen this anywhere else in the world. Instead they made us collect our bags and then depart the airport and re-enter it and head to reservations. Here we were booked on flights the following day but told not to worry as AI would cover transfers, accommodation and food. WOW - this is where it all went WRONG!
We were told to follow a young man (no uniform) and were then ushered into a beaten up taxi with 2 young men (my wife was very scared). We were driven 30 mins and eventually down DIRT alley ways to a run down old ""hotel"". On one sign it was called Grand Shoba and on another it was called Modesty Hotel.
We were shown a room that stunk of cigarette smoke and had cockroaches. We refused and then shown a marginally better room. We went downstairs and said we would like to call AI and were told they didn't know the number and couldn't help us - now we felt scared. We went back to our very bare room (cell maybe) with no hot water, no heater (5c), no towels, no toilet paper and called AI ourselves. They said they were not able to help and hung up on us. We called Delhi Airport and were put through to the Duty Manager of AI who LAUGHED us at and told us to come back to the airport, as we were asking HOW? he hung up on us.
The hotel told us dinner would be available but then delayed the start time twice and eventually called at 9.30PM! I just refused. We never got our 230am wake up call and our pre arranged transfer at 3am was not ready at 3.20am I started screaming at the staff and they agreed to ""wake up"" the driver.
At the airport we complained on check in, we were made to repeat it to the manager, who then made us repeat it to another staff member who took us to reservations desk who made me repeat it again, this staff member started laughing and then I started screaming again and was on the verge of assaulting this man when he ran and got his manager. I repeated it again to Mr Sunil Kumar who shrugged and told me to write it on their website - thats it! No apology, no offer of a voucher, upgrade. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Later on boarding plane a staff member told me they had so many complaints about that hotel they are ending the affiliation but still had quota to fill - GREAT we are nothing more than QUOTA.
I sent a feedback form on their website and have received nothing back. When I check status it has not been updated in 2 weeks! I sent emails to ALL of their corruption/vigilance officers and 1 week later - NOTHING. I sent email to the CEO - nothing.
Note the CEO and Chairman are the same person so not surprisingly there is no management accountability.
But hey, should I be surprised this is India, even their novelists who write about the corruption problems inherent to this nation win booker prizes.
Note the plane to Cochin was on time, it was a much older plane with no entertainment.
We were going to fly AI from Mumbai to Europe but just now booked Qatar airways - its just not worth the risk.
Incredible India!"
