Overall staff ok, flight ok, leg room not so good. Overall experience average."

However, my web-checked in seats are not updated on their system hence didn't get a window seat.Badges were not available at security counter; so I had to rush to check in kiosk to collect it - there was no AI staff to grab it and keep it in adequate amount at security. Anyway, as expectations are very low, these poor services are ignored by others."

I can recommend to take Air India , if:

1) You are a Vegetarian
2) You love to watch Hindi Movies and Bollywood songs
3) Shortest flight from SFO to Delhi
4) Make good friends
5) You like Indian food
6) Good piloting experience
7) You can walk around to make yourself stretched.
8) If you are travelling with parents or you want to make your parents travel alone.
9) Direct connectivity

Also I liked the seats as they are not that bad as I can compare with other air lines"

Business Class",Proportionate.....Travel and ticket price.,"Hello all and to everyone @ Trip. I made a LHR-Delhi-LHR trip last weekend. Business on a old 777-200 LR. Dep last thurs AI 161. Return mon AI 162. Same aircraft on both flights. Seat 8K.
Check was smooth and quick at T4. 13 mins from the moment I dropped the luggage to clearing security. I used the air india maharaja lounge , both at Heathrow and New Delhi.
The one at LHR is at gate 1. Up the stairs.......not helpful for some passengers. At 07:30, I greeted by a lady with a dry smile. Oh never mind!. There was a ""serve yourself"" ....line up of wine bottles, hard.and..soft drinks . There was a selection of buffet , hot and cold. I had a coffee and read a paper till the boarding call was announced. Stewards welcome me into the plane and I was taken to my seat. Up in the air.....breakfast was served. Taste wise , I'd give it 5/10. Dry and microwaved.
Business toilets were quite clean and stocked. Toilet meter 7/10. I'm giving it 3 less because the space inside the loo was quite tight, same as that of the economy. Don't expect any smiles or pampering from the crew. You have to ask everything......whatever your need is. If you don't ask , you don't get. The crew are quite direct in communication. I made a request for pyjamas. After the third request, I got it. Imagine purchasing a chicken doner kebab in a busy grill shop after a friday night out.......!!!! Yes , you can understand what I am saying. A short snack before landing....again tasteless.... Landed at IGI, 15 mins early. Immigration, luggage carousel,customs....out in 30 minutes.
Return flight AI 162 was a similar experience. Well .....the same aircraft but different crew."

Economy",Expert in delaying,"Till date I have traveled thrice with this airline and I have promised to myself I will not make the mistake of booking this flight for domestic travels ever again.
The first time I traveled with this flight from Mumbai to Kolkata, it was delayed by around 4 hours.

The next time I was travelling from Frankfurt to Mumbai. There was a halt at Delhi for 3 hours which was the reason that I booked the flight. I believed a 3 hours break after a 7 hour journey will be nice. But then I realized that the flight was delayed by another 3 hours and 30 minutes. Worst part, they were never sure how much delayed the flight will be. First they said it was delayed by an hour, 30 minutes after saying this they said it is further delayed by another hour and this repeated for another time. Besides, the gates changed and they did not feel the need to announce it till the very end point. Moreover, the lady at the gate was really rude. I was stunned by the tone of her voice when I asked her ""Can you please give me an exact time because I had to schedule a few things"". The reply that I got was ""It is not in my hands"" and believe me the tone in her voice was really rude. This is what pissed me off completely.
I had similar experience with the flight timing while travelling from Kolkata to Delhi to catch a connecting flight to Frankfurt. I had to run to catch my flight to Frankfurt because the domestic flight got delayed by 3 hours again. They said that it was due to foggy weather. What I did not understand is how the other flights to Delhi were running. Do they have some special provisions or did I see wrong in the list?

Anyways, I will seriously suggest not to book Air India for domestic flights. The only thing you may find good is the food (the reason for rating it poor and not terrible)."

This time somehow got carried away with the rates they were offering, 1 hr before i have to check in i get a call from them that the flight is delayed by 1 hr and so does the connecting flight, i get pissed off because i was not expecting this at all, we reach the airport checked in waiting at the security gate to board but the delay was 1 hr 30 mins . Later reached delhi airport had to get the connecting flight and there was toooo much rush since delhi airport is huge Air india didnt arrange any bus service for passengers to reach their point , annoying..........
Next we reach mumbai will all the irritation but things with air india couldnt stop goin wrong. The flight lands at the international airport where as it was supposed to land in domestic airport. Imagine i had asked my car to pick me from domestic airport but here,too Air india gives no intimation about the flight landing else where....... Unexceptable. PLS MAKE NO TRAVELS WITH AIR INDIA ITS ONLY A LET DOWN TO US INDIANS. by featuring in big movies shouldnt help u make more bussiness SHAME"

One of them is a higher baggage allowance for domestic flights. Another is competitive fares, schedules and connectivity. Third is a very wide network often serving places other airlines will enter subsequently.

We were on one of the older double-bogey Airbus 320 aircraft, on a flight going ahead to Port Blair, configured for a full economy seating. Breakfast was satisfactory and filling - omelette, peas, potato chips and a bread roll, with coffee to follow.

I quite enjoyed this flight as it takes the tension out of trying to figure out what to order onboard. Also, once the service is done, the airplane becomes a quiet place.

Clean aircraft."

However, the pilots and crew of this flight were quite professional, and it was a pleasant surprise to be treated to this level of service and professionalism. May their tribe increase, and I hope and pray this airline once again rises like a phoenix from its ashes."

When the stewardess came round she took my tray and promptly turned it upside down on the empty seat next to me spilling the contents on the seat. She then wiped it of leaving a squidgy mess on the seat and that was it. I pity the poor person who next had to sit there. Even though they have Dream-liners on this route they are very tarnished with pieces of plastic coming loose and sinks stuck together with duck-tape. Service is very poor with only one cup of tea and usually drinks seem to be at a premium. The selection of films to watch is very limited for western people even though flying from the west
