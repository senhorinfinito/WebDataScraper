The short duration restricted cabin service to answering to sporadic requests for water. Air India appeared reliable in this region.

Economy",Comfortable but ageing,"Air India has some good points and many bad ones. The good is that they operate mostly wide-bodied aircraft so seating even in economy class in tolerable. Also, they have some of the best and most experienced pilots in the Indian skies today.

The cons are many and they begin with the web-site. The site has a mind of its own. At times the ticket purchase is smooth, at others it is completely unpredictable. Random pages will open, and often, no page will appear.

The check-in process is mostly very bad. The staff, with rare exceptions, is inefficient and make it clear that the passenger is not a priority for them. Even with a web check-in, just a bag-drop takes ages

I have had bizarre experiences like the flight getting delayed because the staff at the gate insisted that the crew had not reported and after a 30 minute delay, the Captain coming out of the aircraft to find out why passengers were not being boarded as the entire crew had been in the aircraft for an hour!

The newer cabin crew are generally courteous and helpful but not empowered to do much for a passenger

The map/entertainment systems are mostly out of order. The meal is included in the fare, and generally eatable, though the presentation is poor

The cabin and the toilets are not very clean

The airline suffers from old aircraft and inefficient staff"

That said, if you are jittery about flying, try them. The best pilots in the business, you will not know when you are airborne or have touched down. And the chefs have to be awarded a Michellin star. Amazing food."

Economy",You will regret it like myself,"To add on to this the customer service on the plane was terrible I could not eat my first meal because it had soil in it. Not wanting to be a difficult customer I asked for a different meal which I received, but could not eat because the hostess had taken my cutlery she offered to return with another set of cutlery which she never returned with. Of course, I pressed the help button a number of times still no one came. The very same hostess came back to collect my tray of food not even bothering to apologise or something she only pretended not to have seen I had not touched my tray of food.
The next flight I had with your airline was not any better, attempting to eat what I had been offered I found HAIR in my food again I was not able to eat! Overall I was and still I'm furious with the services that you offered.

Misled by their call centre services in London in regards to my luggage allowance, not being able to eat and to make my experience worse the headphones were not working! I was and I still am furious."

Business Class",Not quite business class experience,"I am a high-mileage business flier so am familiar with what business class should look like. Air India is Economy plus at best. The dinner was fine, although still serve din an aluminum tin and served without any input from me. As for entertainment, there is NO western music on the set -- none, zilch, nada. Glad I brought along my iPad. When I said I did not want alcohol, it drew a derisive remark from one of the flight attendants. Although the airplace was a nice 787, the inside was already looking worn, the wood was rubbed raw, the outlet did not work, and the attitude of the business flight attendants was, well, awkward. I say awkward because of two issues that stand out. the first is that when a passenger is sleeping on other airlines, they are not bothered by the service. Not on Air India -- I was awakened from a cold dead sleep by the attendant who told me it was time to wake up and eat dinner. Argh! Other than scaring the living cat out of me, it was just rude to say that to a client. The second event was after dinner -- I had the tray out, with my computer and was working away. Suddenly the attendant comes over, lowers the luggage bin and drops a pillow into my lap. No greeting, no warning, no questions about whether I want a pillow or not. I asked him if something was happening, he said he was getting my duvet ready and it was time for sleeping now. Well, to me it was 4PM, not time to sleep and time instead to get my work done. Argh. Air India has a long way to go. But honestly, from the attitude of these two flight attendants, I am not sure it wants to go there."
