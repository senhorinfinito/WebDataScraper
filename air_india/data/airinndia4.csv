We went to baggage claim counter but there was no representative from Air India side, after 30mins or so we found one Air India guy & told him about our missing baggage, he said he will find out but all he did was to give us PIR( Property Irregularity Report) reciept & told us that baggage will b delivered to our address by evening 4:00pm. We are still waiting for baggage & no one responds to phone nos written on PIR reciept. It feels like abyss.its over 48hrs now & our baggage is still untraced.there is no online site to track lost baggage or any customer care service to help.This callous attitude of Air India is very frustrating, it may b just a baggage for them but I lost things very dear to me. I am never going to board airindia again.
Can anyone please help me with this?"

I had a flight from India to Singapore . There was a huge delay of six hours and then , when our family went to the airlines . We were given the last backrow three seats when we had booked for the middle order . When we demanded why this decision took place, they said that it was a smaller flight than how it was supposed to be thus , they took such a decision. The next thing I get to know it a huge crowd of folks and women disturbing us to go to the washroom . We couldn't catch a wink of sleep with all the hustle bustle from all the people who went to the washroom . The airhosts didn't do anything to stop this . Bad experience because of the confusion of the flight ! The flight is also not proper , food was not great and overall , just don't take this flight."

Economy",The worst Air Line in the world,"I had a business trip from Mumbai to Chennai. Was planning to go late in evening and then had meetings the next day.

Took AI 94 from BOM to MAA scheduled at 18:35. Since it is Air India the flight was delayed to 19:00 and then finally took off at 19:30. Which means I lost one hour at the Airport doing nothing. Reached hotel late and then did not get enough sleep.

The return journey was another big story.
Took AI 93 from MAA to BOM @ 21:35. Fortunately the flight was on time but when I boarded the flight there was no space for my Cabin bag which was 20 inches American Tourister.

I requested them to check once again so that if there is place they can accommodate. The staff was pathetic, no one to help. Finally they asked me to check in my bag where I had no choice but to agree.

Once I landed and fortunately on time again @ 23.35 my bag is lost, stolen or dissapeared in the sky I don't know.

I met the baggage claim department and asked them that I waited until the last bag and the conveyer belt also stopped now. It is 1 am already.

The baggage department is very cool about these incidences, they were like this is very normal you will get your bag sir. We encounter a lot of customers daily and our appraisal is based on the number of customers. They filled some form online and took details of stuff inside my bag.

I asked them can you call Chennai or check with the ground staff, they were like no sir you will get your bag delivered tomorrow. I am getting tensed and worried about my documents, clothes, keys and what not which is inside the bag.

It is 2.30 am already after a lot of fire fighting they send me home telling me that if you don't get a call from us till 9 am you can call us and we will let you know.

Reached home at 3.30 am wondrring why the hell did I choose this flight.

Next day morning at 9.30 am no one called finally I started calling the airport in Chennai and Mumbai. But they they have a app called world tracer which was showing no status update.

Got through staff at Chennai and they told me that they have sent the bag in the morning by another flight scheduled to reach by 8.30 am. I told them it is 10.30 am already no one called me.

At 11.30 am someone calls me from Mumbai airport saying that your bag has arrived. Felt like I won a Jack pot, hurray.

When I reach the airport there is no one picking the calls. Went from P4 to P6 to P10 all places where I could find one Air India personall who can help.

Wasted almost 2 hours with my 1.5 year infant kid who wanted to run and play at the Airport.

The 10th floor sales office of Air India is also not able to contact their baggage claim department on phone, intercom and mobile. In fact they are asking us to complain about this to Air India.

Finally someone picked up and Deepak helped us from Baggage claim to get my luggage back.

If you look at the instances I have gone through so much of stress overnight, no sleep and wasted the entire night and day behind this pathetic Air Line and their staff.

I highly recommend to avoid this Air Line, I would rather not travel if I am going through this Air Line."

All my trips to Germany via Frankfurt were on Air India. After that, there was an abdication of sorts, and my trips to Frankfurt over the last 8 years were always on other carriers. So it was a pleasurable surprise to find that when I was making my booking several months ago for the Trivandrum to Frankfurt trip, Air India offered the cheapest plan as Trivandrum-Delhi-Frankfurt. I chose that plan but last week I got a call from Air India that the flight from Delhi to Frankfurt was being advanced by 1 hr. that would mean just half an hour to make it from the aero bridge on arrival at Delhi to the boarding gate. Air India assured my travel agent that they will arrange to get it done and they kept their promise. AI 0466 reached Delhi at 10.45am on time. An AI staffer was waiting for me at the aero bridge with my name on a placard, took me through the International transit checkin, the by passed the regular line and took me through a special channel at immigration and then through security and took me through the long distance to Gate 21 exactly at 11.15am, just in time for the commencement of boarding.

Crew attitude is the first thing that haunts me (believe me, I was very much upset for few days after the trip by the way how the crew treated us).
The aircraft being a fairly new one (Dreamliner) one would expect good overall conditiona and upkeep. however to our surprise, the aircraft was in very bad shape (the home button on the screen was not there, USB ports were all damaged, on demand games and few movie contents were not available, window shade button was damaged etc.etc.)
We have booked special meals for kids and ourselves, but that was not provided (anyhow on requesting they said they do not serve Pork and beef, so their meal would qualify as any special meal you name it)
Kids finally were served opened meal after long time.
The service crew/ attendants never showed up after initial service.
The quality of snack provided towards the end of the flight was below our expectations.
Over all, it was a nightmare.

Did not have much expectations after my past experiences in the eighties and early nineties, before private airlines were allowed, when I had to no option but to fly Air India/Indian Airlines. Was a loyal Jet Airways customer since it started. In the recent past, following Jet Aorways' closure, tried Vistara, SpiceJet, Indigo and GoAir. Vistara was like the Jet Airways of yester years, but has poor connections and frequency. SpiceJet was good. Indigo and GoAir were not upto the mark.

But the Air India flights were a pleasant surprise. Clean cabin, good leg space, on-time departure and arrival, and young and pleasant flight attendants. Was offered hot snacks, where were not great, but palatable. Considering that private airlines other than Vistara fleece you on food, being given hot snacks was very welcome.

The flight was supposed to be a one stop flight with a stopover at Delhi for about 2 hours. At Delhi I realised the flight was showing Vienna / Chicago which on enquiry was told there is a fueling stopover at Vienna for an hour.

The air hostesses on the flight from Delhi to Chicago never offered any alcohol nor were Courteous enough to answer the seat call. I personally saw them switch off all the call buttons when they were indicated in their staff area. They were simply more busy chatting amongst themselves.

At Vienna, the ground staff (locals) entered the flight and cleaned up the messy toilets. And instead do and hour we were held up in a hostage like situation for 2 hours. We weren't allowed to use toilets and the doors were opened up with 4 degrees temperature outside.

Suddenly the crew left with their bags and new set arrived. Which again was a bit confusing.

The journey there on got a bit better with new staff atleast asking us for alcohol and drinks. But they had the same attitude of not attending the seat calls.

We were supposed to land at 7am in Chicago and eventually landed at noon! Which delayed all travel itenary.

Anyways. It's high time Air India realises they they need to take up things professionally. Even if the stopover at Vienna was important due to ban on Indian flights above Pakistan airspace it could have been much better as an experience for guests.

International

So we booked the tickets. I was very sceptic about flying experience of Air India. My last venture with them was in 1990. After that I never flew with them. But since there was no alternative, I looked forward to it.

As regards Hardware of Air India, the aeroplane was Boing Dreamliner. So it was quite big & had plenty of legroom. Sitting was comfortable. The entertainment consisted of touchscreen LCD panel with wide choices of movies, TV shows etc. The choice & variety being very good,I enjoyed watching them. Thus far it was ok. But LCD panels in the middle row, suddenly stopped working after 2 hours. For the balance 6 hours, they had total blackout on screen. Technical fault, they declared. On the return flight to India, TV went on & off several times & finally when it started, few could not hear anything. Fortunately I could hear & see, but the interactive map was off & no progress of flight could be seen.

As regards air hostess & flight attendants, lesser said the better. I had a feeling that air hostesses are glamourous, good looking, soft spoken. However Air India dashed my that impression. Looking at Air India hostesses, I am convinced just anybody who has 2 arms & 2 legs with zero warmth, courtesy, bad looks & hardly any ability to tow the food trolley can become air hostesses. The same is with flight attendants. They were rude, totally bad looking, panting while towing the food trolleys. Their style of asking for food choice was so rude that I wondered if anyone had ever trained them. When asked for a second drink they so rudely rebuffed, that I felt I committed a crime. They declared that they had no snacks to offer with drinks....no peanuts, pretzels, no chips, nothing. She said it was simply not stocked! She spilt the drinks on a few occasions. Fortunately meals were good, tasty & sumptuous. So we could get by.

As regards general fitness of any flight attendant or air hostess, I honestly believed that in case of emergency, they would not be in any position to offer any help or comfort or confidence to passengers. They themselves looked so tired in their own chores & panted all along.

While landing at Frankfurt airport, there was a huge thud with which it landed, that my fellow passenger screamed with terror. It was Mothers' Day & all the passengers desperately must have remembered their own dear mothers!

Thus in spite of having good hardware, perhaps the people who manage the Air India right from ground staff, maintenance technicians. air hostess, flight attendants to pilots, they lack any sense of enthusiasm to keep good acceptable standard of service. No doubt they have run up Rs.seventy thousand crore rupees (9968 million USD bad debt).

Economy",They give zero F@&#'s,"I don't often write reviews unless a company really stands out - and this one did. I do a fair amount of flying due to my professional and love of travel, and I have NEVER had such a horrible experience. From the moment they came on the intercom of my first leg to let us know there were technical difficulties and they had to go back to the airport of origin, it was complete chaos (and not the normal Indian organized chaos).

The airline staff did not communicate well at all, though they did excel at the evasive white lies to temporarily appease guests. They would say to wait and then in an hour or two they would say to wait longer...in the meantime we all lost any opportunity to make alternative plans as all the other flights left the airport without us.

They didn't know how to handle the crowd in the customer service line. People kept barging into their office and, instead of insisting that they get in the queue with the rest of us, they would help these people first negatively reinforcing that people should continue to barge into their office and demand to be helped first and neglecting those waiting (semi)patiently in the queue.

After 7 hours at the airport, they told us we would have taxi's to a hotel that they would cover. They made us all sit at airport and wait for over an hour and then brought a bus to take us to a cockroach infested, fire trap (no, seriously, a room started on fire when the AC unit blew up, while I was there) hotel that didn't have enough rooms for us all. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Needless to say, as I sat at the hotel at 1:30am with no room and no way to contact the airline, I was less than thrilled. Fortunately someone else without a room had called to complain and they came to pick up up and drop up at another hotel. So, at 2am, 10 hours after arriving at the airport, I got settled and ready to replay the next day.

They had no taxi scheduled to pick me up and didn't know anything about my case when I called in from the hotel the following day. The flight was delayed again and they never bothered to inform me nor did they follow through with any communication regarding my questions or concerns.

When I arrived in Delhi, I went in search of customer service as instructed and was sent on a wild goose chase as no one wanted to deal with me or had any interest in actually helping me with anything. After walking around the airport to three different locations, getting no help and nearly having a meltdown, I gave up.

The flight itself was also below average. The flight staff was super into customer service either. The woman next to me was throwing up a number of times during our 20 hour flight and the attendants never stopped by once to check on her or at least to switch out her puke bags, leaving her husband and I to care for her. Also, I've got to say that there entertainment selection was hideous...perhaps I'm spoiled, but if you're going to have the same people on your plane for nearly 24hrs, you could spring for more than few dozen old movie titles.

Today I am a happy camper again, back home in the US, but I felt it important to share my experience and let others know that I would HIGHLY recommend flying with anyone BUT Air India.

Thanks and safe travels."

None of the screens on our part of the plane worked. So we had a 9 hour flight with no way of knowing how far away from our destination we were and with no in flight entertainment. We weren't even told about this or given an apology. The air hostess waited for me to ASK and then just said ""sorry they aren't working"" and walked off! The plane seats were SO uncomfortable I barely got any sleep. They are rock hard! Worst seats on a plane I have ever experienced. Seats are better on budget airlines! Some staff were nice but most were unsmiling and intimidating. We kept trying to call for an airhostess but the light would just be turned off and no one would come. I would never fly Air India again!"

As a consequence, about 40 persons lost their connections. We received hotel, yet at 2 am we were taken back to the airport. I had especially bought a ticket with secured transfer. Due to a cyclone that was coming to my destination city, Bhubaneswar, all the flights were cancelled for two days (so from the 2nd of May till the 5th of May 2019). At 2:30 in the morning, when I asked what shall I do in Delhi for two days, the officer told me Air India is not responsible in case of calamity. I asked if they can reserve a room for me, and the price was 5200 rupees. I agreed, asking them to proceed. After half an hour waiting, when I asked is reserved, the officer allegedly made me get out of the airport, one employee took my luggage and made me sign for going out! Afterwards, another officer told me to just take a cab and go somewhere! I insisted on them to reserve a room, as I am a foreigner studying in India. They told me to wait. After five hours of waiting, a friend advised me to ask before everything for a place on the first flight. At that hour, 7:30 am, it was a huge amount of people waiting. Yet, eight employees were doing nothing. When I asked why they did not do my reservation at 2 am, they refused to talk to me, and told me to go in the queue. I refused and asked them to solve the problem. Eventually, one lady gave me one leaflet, with a place reserved on the last flight, after two days (as all the other had already been taken by then!). I left the airport and stayed with some friends. The day I arrived for the flight, the 5th of May, the place was actually not reserved. Yet they found a place and I flew back, Shame New Dehi Air India Assistance Office! I will avoid flying with Air India from now on and I advise al who fly to find other companies if they want to be treated like human beings!"

I was travelling to Dhaka for a workshop. On may 3,2019 ( Friday) reached Bangalore Airport at 9.30 and came to know that the flight to Dhaka is cancelled due to Fani Cyclone. I argued with the Air India staff in Bangalore and it was not useful. They only suggested, you can fly up to Kolkata and decide. I took a chance and on reaching Kolkata, I came to know that the entire airport has been shut for 24 hours.
I met this very nice officer from Air India-Mr.Uday Shankar Tumloor and expressed my concern. He only assured me that if the flight is flying then I will fly to Dhaka. However, the airport is shut and nothing can be done today and advised to stay in some hotel for a day. He even offered a couple of good hotel names. He asked me to call tomorrow for the update.
I received a call from Uday on the next day morning around 8 a.m. And he expressed that due to there is some technical difficulty in issuing tickets to me and asked me to come to the airport.
On reaching airport, and he was so kind to give a boarding pass for the same evening flight. I could not believe myself. It was a magic. I even now wonder; how could this happen to me. I was a lovely experience to meet Uday sir, I am posting a photo. Again in the evening, he met and enquired about me.

They offered food and beverages as normal but when you flick the help light for someone to come...don’t expect anyone just get up and get it yourself, my light pinged for hours and no one came, all I wanted was a pillow for this now 11hour flight instead of 8hours!!! The leg room in economy isn’t great and the seats are pretty sardined together. Would rate the whole experience 3/10 due to delays, quality of food, customer service and amenities offered.

P.s I have added a menu of what’s offered at Amritsar airport, try and avoid there was mould on the food sitting in the viewing window on the kebabs, cakes and sarnies...to get a tea is super slow...also if you do want key rings (decent ones) I found this airport with only one gate had the best ones but 400 rupees each so is very expensive!"

Economy",Worst air experience ever.,"This was truly the worst experience ever. We had booked air India specifically with the intention having a seamless transfer in New Delhi on the way to Lucknow.

5 days before our flight we were sent an email to say our return flight was cancelled. No changes, no we have booked you on an alternative flight. Spend 1.5 hours on hold on the phone before an operator answered and then had to rearrange the return flight to London instead of Birmingham.

On the day of the flight when checking in, we are told that the luggage will not go straight through to Lucknow. We have to collect the luggage in New Delhi, clear immigration and customs and then drop it off to a transfer belt. Our booking had a one hour connection at Delhi. At no point in the booking process was this information given to us or else I would have booked a longer transit in New Delhi to sort all of this out.

Spoke to the air India counter at Birmingham airport and this is where things really went down hill. I have never come across worse customer service anywhere in the world. So unbelievably rude and patronising. The staff essentially said it was our fault for booking these flights, we should have known better and there is nothing they can do. Eventually they started shouting at as - it was beyond farcical.

The flight from Birmingham eventually left 2 hours late. So we missed our planned connection anyway. We had to them plead our way on to the next air India flight to Lucknow from Delhi which was 6 hours later.

Oh and the entire bag collection and drop off process with customs and immigration took a solid 2 hours at the airport.

I think it’s safe to say we’ll never fly Air India again but honestly, I get the feeling no one at Air India will care. There is no love or dedication to the company from its own employees. What a shame."

Finally got to know that the Gate no. has been provided from a staff but the same was not announced or updated in the digital boards. When the boarding started, there were two weird vehicles attached to the stairs of the plane, which were basically for another round of security check. It was so hard to get up in those vehicles as the stairs were steep and my mom and dad who are old, struggled badly. Male security persons were opening ladies purses and searching them so disrespectfully. When I asked what's this checking for, I was not given any answers. The body check was also done in the most disrespectful way and everyone was feeling frustrated. When we finally came onboard, none of the staff or the captain apologised for the almost 2 hrs delay. Everyone seemed as if the flight is on time. Finally landed in Kolkata and many passengers missed their connecting flights because of such irresponsible behaviour of Air India. Never again!

We arrived to the airport 3 hours early because we knew the check in lines would be pretty long from past experience. We waited in line like civilized human beings and as we got to the front of the line a few hours later the experience took a horrific turn...

The check in staff was so incredibly rude to my team. They proceeded to scold us because “ there are people behind you in line who depart before you; therefore, we had to wait until they came through. I’m sorry but what kind of customer derive is that? Why is it our fault that we followed the basic rules of arriving to the airport early to check in? Why should we potentially risk missing our flight because people arrived after us? The situation got worse as the check in agent proceeded to put his hand in my face and literally said “ shut up” when I was not even being rude. I was purely trying to make a statement that we would not back away after waiting for 3 hours.

Then the chaos continued... We boarded the plane and realized there were people in our seats we had specifically selected. I get claustrophobic and hate sitting in the middle which is why I always pre check and pay for the seats I prefer. Well rather than helping us out with an aggressive customer who had sat down in our seats just because they were free the flight attendant told us to find other seats and did not attempt to resolve the situation. He essentially made us feel like it was our fault for not getting to OUR seats first. What kind of service is this where you enable people who have no manners and can’t follow rules to abuse foreign travelers?? We ended up getting placed in the only remaining seats in business class and THE SAME MAN demanded that we now pay for business class seats! Why would you not resolve the issue ahead OR just assume you shouldn’t force customers to pay for seats that we didn’t intend to have in the first place?

Air India is horrific and I suggest everyone pay the extra $15 to fly ANY OTHER airline. They don’t give one damn about their paying customers and give their company a horrible name. I certainly will never fly them, even if they are Star Alliance members!"

It is always a pleasure to fly the Air bus 787 dream liner operated by Air India on this route with its full stretchable seats that converts itself into a flat bed. The check-in was handled very efficiently by Mr Sato.
Overall it was a very smooth flight without much of turbulence. The landing at Delhi particularly was very smooth, demonstrating the attention and the skill of Capt. Rajat Rana.
The food served on board was really delicious with good choices and the service by Ms Suruchira Malhotra and Ms Saraswathi L was really great. Both of them were so courteous and efficient and were eager to attend to each and every need of the passengers. There is certainly scope for improvement is the in-flight entertainment options, though.

Even upon calling their Customer Service Number in Bombay, the time of departure was not clear. The flight departed 7 hours after it's scheduled time printed on the ticket. The ""Rescheduling"" was an excuse to cover up delays due to crew shortage.
In flight, the cabin staff were curt, if not downright rude, telling the passengers not to use lavatories every so often, either due to turbulence or meal service. The food served was decent, so one star for that. The service was sadly pathetic, the staff banging down food trays and beverage glasses and coming back to ""clear"" the cabin in brief order )this was a 15 hour flight!). Apparently, the cabin crew were tired and in a hurry to get some rest. The Stewardess in the tail end of the plane put on a red warning light and told the passengers that the toilet was out of order, the staff made merry use of the same toilet while passengers could not. It was clear that the staff were looking after themselves and passengers were not a priority.

Single women, families, biz executives were put through a lot of misery as you can imagine but the airline could not care less. we had ONLY ONE PERSON to PROVIDE TRANSIT CARDS to 360 passengers. the overall process of checking the system and handing over cards made everyone sweat it out.

The flight was on time, dreamliner is always a wonderful experience and flying your National carrier always makes you proud, Meals were served on this flight . The audio video systems were all functioning well. So next time you plan to travel Air India , do look for their Dreamliners even on the domestic front."

On our outbound journey in row 35 the window tv screen didn't work at all and the passenger requested to be moved; the middle screen for us worked in a limited way and only after intense frustration; the aisle screen worked so we satisfied ourselves with AI's sub-par selection of entertainment. On the return journey all three screens in our row 31 announced a media center malfunction from the start. So not only did we have to bear with a 16-hour flight without entertainment, but since the screens could not be shut off, the AI stewardess creatively screened the monitors with old newspapers - she must have done this before as she knew the solution immediately. On another note, the seat reading light controls did not work and the call-buttons did not work, so we used camping headlights to read. Strangely in the middle of the night, every single seat reading light in the economy class cabin turned on for about 30 minutes - think several hundred bright torches / flashlights in a dark room - only to go dark again."

Once you bid the credit card is charged. They claim that they will confirm the seat only at the check-in counter (that is what I understood).

But to my surprise at the check-in counter, they said that they would confirm it only at the boarding gate.

So the airline expected me to wait until the boarding to know if I had been upgraded.

When I reached the boarding gate they said that the flight is still open and they have no information. and also I had to wait for the flight staff to arrive to allocate the seat if any.

The boarding had started and they still did not have information on the upgrade. I had to wait and wait. until almost all had boarded. After that only they confirmed my upgrade.

Is it worth the wait after paying for it? not for me any more.

I later learnt that passengers that had not bid and were willing to pay and upgrade at the Check-in counter got upgraded instantly.

I think Air-India needs to rethink this process. it is a hassle and a lot of inconveniences."

Till the day we never know the real reason for the delay. The only great thing they did at least supplied food in the afternoon.
We contacted Air India regarding compensation for delay however, the request was denied. Currently, we are seeking legal help.
It is one of the most expensive airlines with such a poor service, the major problems are,
1. Always late
2. poor food quality
3. Always blocked/ unclean toilet
4. Poor customer service
These are the common experience when I traveled with my family as well.
So if you want to save some money and get good service I would highly recommend Singapore, Emirates or Malaysian airlines.

At this stage , according to their website I should have expected an apology and a compensation. Instead the blame is shifted onto me ???

Trying to update our information pre-flight was an absolute challenge (Air India's website kept timing out while I was entering info online), we were not able to select any seats online even within 24 hours before the flight, the assigned seats were all scattered throughout the airplane so that my two daughter (2 and 7 years old) were supposed separate without a parent or even a sibling, and you could not print any boarding passes. We went to the airport early to get seats together. The lady checking us in tried her best and at least had the four of us sit closer two each other (two together, one a row in front, and the fourth in the same row but on the other side of the isle). Surprisingly people traveling together sitting around us had exactly the same issues going on AND my husband, who sat in front of us, had an empty seat besides him (So why not put our daughter, who was scheduled to sit on her own on the other side of the isle sit next to him?). In a combined effort of multiple rows we all managed to switch around and did what the airline was not able to do and have people that travel together actual sit together. The food was pretty awful. When we got on board we got advised that we would receive our stroller, which they took at the gate, back at the gate when arriving in Goa. This was NOT the case. Old plane with absolutely no inflight entertainment. The actual touchdown of the plane is Goa was so rough that we expected to at least bust tire... shocking. Besides that it would have been helpful to get ""immigration cards"" on the place so we could have them filled out before landing in Goa and not had to do that in the terminal when landing at 3:30am. On the way back .... WOW ... is all I can say. My husband had flown home a few days before the rest of the family. He says that his food was uneatable on board and that the baggage claim in Dubai took forever. The girls and I returned from Goa to Dubai yesterday and had an AWFUL flight. Again, we could not pick seats prior to check in to the flight and the airline had us not sit together ( At least this time the two year old was sitting with me and not on her own). We got put in the last row with me sitting with my two year old and my 7 year old 3 seats over on the other side of the isle. Staff told us that there is nothing they can do about that. Luckily a lovely lady helped us out so we could sit together (Thank you). The ordered meals were not there but we did not get told that. Instead the crew just plopped a vegetarian meal on a tray with a juice and gave it to the girls. The hot meal was so spicy that even I could not eat it. They ran out of orange juice, apple juice, and peanuts. The smell of the bathrooms were agonizing. The line of people crowding us in our seats was plainly annoying. In total all our meals were bad to uneatable. Our seats could not recline. A guy was TALKING on his phone when coming into land. When pointing it out and complaining to the stewardess she just said that there is nothing they can do and to feel free to complain to the airline. The airplane itself was old and dirty. No inflight entertainment at all. Baggage collection was shocking. Our stroller, which they had taken at the gate in Goa, did not get brought out till FAR after the last suitcase had been delivered on the belt. I am 7+ months pregnant, traveling with two young kids, and NOBODY EVERY offered to help but we got put in the worst seats of the plane with awful food and no drinks left since they ran out (Oh, lots of booze on board though)."

The scheduled departure  was at 9.50 and I reached airport at 8.30. Following is my overall experience about the flight ( Rating given out of 5, 5 being the highest):-
A. Check-in: Checking at the self check in kiosk was smooth. Travelling with Hand Baggage .(Rating 4).
B. Lounge access: I was flying economy and hence there was no lounge faculty offered. I used my Mastercard to access airport lounge.(Rating Neutral)
C. Boarding and departure: Flight was delayed by 55 min. Scheduled departure was at 9.50 but delayed departure at 10.45. 55 minutes delay in a 1 hour flight is so appalling. Boarding opened at 10.00 at Gate 23C by bus. Boarding process was smooth and fast. Push back was at 10.40 and we took off at 10.45 (Rating 3).
D. Seats and interior: The aircraft was an Airbus A319 series and looked well maintained. The interior in beige looked bright and well lit. Seats upholstered in orange and yellow ochre gives vibrancy in the feel. My selected seat was 17D, an aisle seat from the rear. Seat pitch was comfortable legspace was ok for a 1 hour flight. Seat recline was about 110 degree.(Rating 4.5).
E. In flight Service: Light snacks of Frooti and sandwich was provided in the flight. Great gesture in a 55 minute flight. In-flight magazine Shubh Yatra provides quality light reading . (Rating 4).
F. Arrival and baggage: Flight landed at 11.50. Gates were opened at 11.55 (Rating 4)
G.Overall flight experience and suggested area of improvement : Barring delay, overall flying experience was good. Staff was well groomed and polite. Delay downgraded my overall rating(OVERALL RATING 3.75)"

One very long queue for people who need to check in from scratch. Then if you have been to the self check in and just need to do Bag Drop off it is a total mess with no one over seeing it. People are there who have to check on from scratch instead of where they should be. People push in right to the counter staff and they still attend to them and don’t send them to the back of the queue. Six men arrived with many suitcases and parcels each and an Air India employee tried to get them checked in to Baggage drop from scratch despite the massive queue. It was a total mess and took nearly an hour to do a Baggage Drop. Air India have jet themselves down massively here.

After more than 2 hours on the phone with Air India to confirm the cancellation, we also had to email the e-commerce department to arrange a refund (you can't call them).

When we arrived in Delhi for our connecting flight we were told that the first segment had not been cancelled. We showed them the confirmation email from Air India. It took so long for them to sort it out that we MISSED our Bodhgaya flight.

It took another 2 hours to get that ticket reissued for the next day. They took no responsibility for the missed flight and provided no compensation for the loss of our hotel room in Bodhgaya, the extra hotel night in Delhi or meals.

Since coming back home to Canada, I've emailed them 3 times with no response.
The refund they originally promised for the cancelled segment has not been provided.

I now understand why there were so many angry customers at the Air India counter that day in the Delhi airport.
They have the worst customer service I've ever seen - they don't even pretend to assist you.
AND THEY'VE STOLEN THE MONEY OWED TO US.

We flew several other domestic airlines (with no issues) who provided great customer service.

No response just wait for 10 min please, same answer all the time.
Then they took us again to migration, security and gate 43 this time (we did this process 3 times).

We have flown with Air India in the distant past and decided to choose this airline due to the convenience is provided in the form of the best connections which meant less travel time. However, we were delighted we chose this airline as they have genuinely upped their game compared to the other well-known brands and I believe they now are a serious contender in this industry.

The aircraft was immaculately maintained, the air hosts provided service with an authentic desire to make our journey as comfortable as possible, and the seats and legroom in the economy were legendary!

They catered to all dietary requirements and with good quality food for all the airline food jokes we hear :-) The entertainment system kept all four of us entertained throughout the flight, and we have very different tastes.

I can't end a review without giving credit where credit is due- the hosts on the flight who worked very hard were very pleasant and displayed a level of professionalism that was impressive. They were the key ingredient in making the trip world-class.

1. the flight was avoiding pak air space for few weeks before my flight but Air India never bothered to update the delayed schedule on website. deliberately lying and misleading customers only to announce at the beginning of the flight that we will arrive 4 hours late.

2. AI knew that i would miss my connecting flight but still let me book the ticket.

3. the return flight back to IAD was delayed for 5 hours. arrived at 1 a.m. instead of 7 a.m. it was a 21 hour flight instead of a 16 hour flight . they have been consistantly late for weeks ( for valid reason as they were avoiding pak airspace) but didn't bother mentioning this scheuld when I was booking my ticket.

I tried to call the airline and the airport for 3 times, nobody gave me a decent information about the hotel and the reason for changing the schedule of stopover time for 10 minutes.

Meal service was chaotic, many passengers being missed. Coffee was impossible to get hold of. Food tasted ok but I now have food poisoning. Having avoided meat in India over several weeks, I stupidly decided it should be ok on the plane but I'm guessing the chicken curry was the culprit.
On clearing up, one unsmiling, even grumpy crew member had not locked her rubbish cart so a load of rubbish was deposited in the aisle. If was cleared up but no apologies.
The person sitting in the middle seat felt unwell and should have been moved ,- Air India seem to always keep the back row free for staff. This didn't happen. The person behind me had an asthma attack. There were 2 announcements asking passengers to remain seated which a passenger doctor attended to her. No effect and all the staff crowded around too. Very unprofessional.

There were young children, whose parents did not enforce the seat belts on them, standing on the seats at take off, and wandering about at landing!! An accident waiting to happen. If it had just been on this flight I would have blamed the crew, but it happened on both long haul and internal flights so is obviously bad training on Air Indias part. The person next to my husband had her tray table down and her very large bag on that the entire flight. She even ate her meal on top of the bag and the crew said nothing. It has definitely made me think twice about travelling with them again."

I spent over 4 hours waiting on Hold trying to contact AI Call Centres - on Delhi, Mumbai & Chennai Numbers trying to find out if there would be a charge to change the Date of the Return Flight and if so, how much. The T's & C's say there are no penalties/fees after the onward journey has been done (except for the Fare Difference, if any).
Finally after a 20 min wait on one day, I got hold of someone and after checking the availability for the new date, she mentioned that it would be the Fare Deptt who would be able to tell me the Price ! She then transferred me and the line got disconnected after 40 mins. She confirmed that someone would call me back on my number (which I updated). A week and past the travel date, no call back from anyone !
I even sent emails, only to be given the same contact numbers that I have trying unsuccessfully.

B'lore airport was a mess. Had 2 hours layoff for the outbound Flight.
1) Only 1 Counter for Foreign Passports and the guy was super slow, taking 20 mins for each person.
2) Luggage for hardly 50 passengers takes more than 30 mins.
3) No one in Air India knows where to deposit the luggage for the connecting Air India Flight. Someone asked me to just put it on the conveyor Belt, which I did, only to run and retrieve it later.
4) 500+ people in Q for Security early morning at 5:00.
5) Display was showing Gate No 6 for Kolkata (Air India). On reaching Gate 6, they said it was Spice Jet only and asked me to wait. It was 5:45 and scheduled departure was 5:50 and display showing Boarding from Gate 6. On asking a 2nd lady, she says, it's Gate 4. No one in Gate 4. Then someone says Gate 2, which is not even on the same Floor. Escalator only coming down, not going up. Mad rush for a lift and finally it was Gate 2 and just escaped missing the Flight by seconds. From their attitude, they wouldn't have bothered leaving a few passengers with Boarding passes behind (doubt very much if all connecting passengers made through on time). No announcements, not even interested when I mentioned that the display was showing wrong Gate info."

Fair enough, not their fault at that but the way it was dealt with by the crew was just awful. They did not answer any question or call bells. The Capt made only one PA. One time when we finally got some answers the flight attendant wasn't the most helpful in any way, quite the opposite while I had informed him that I may miss my connection. They closed the doors then they reopened the doors again and again, very unprofessional and obviously the reason that they will be going bankrupt soon as well.

He did not offer to help stow the luggage but was obviously discontent with my helping my husband and being in his way on this narrow isleway. I should have taken a picture of this man and reported him but he was shoving inappropriately. We do have to return via this airline and will demand that the employees who work for it take proper measures to control unruly persons.

This time when flying to Port Blair from New Delhi the ticket agent aggressively asked for our tickets as if we were in trouble. When we asked him why he was being so hostile, he simply started joking around with his colleague and ignored us. When we asked him for his manager, he said he did not have one. It was as if we were on an airline prank show.
The rest of the flight was the same terrible nightmare it always is. Rude service, cramped seats, dirty bathrooms, and no real system for getting people on or off airplanes. It is as if the people at Air India got most of their information from running an airline by watching the movie Airplane without the sound on and not understanding that it was all meant to be facetious. Sadly, because of over-subsidies this terrible airline will continue to be present on some of the most convenient routes in India because they do not pay a price for their incompetence.

Really? Really?! Our stomachs were doing quite enough sinking of their own accord after suffering 48 hours of the Myanmar Malady.

We checked at the front desk and while Air India is famous for its delays, we still hadn’t thought it would happen to us. Yep. 11 pm departure now heading out at 2.40 am. Thanks Google. Thanks a bunch. It was around 7pm at that point and we settled in for the long haul. Luckily were were ensconced in Singapore Air’s Silver Kris Lounge in Terminal 2. The airmchairs pulled together well and the staff magicked up some pillows and blankets and we caught some much needed sleep as the night wore on and the lounge emptied out. There were about 3 of us left at 1.30 am when we trekked to the gate.

With recent heightened tensions in the region we weren’t surprised to have to go through yet another layer of security. This was our first flight on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner and these are big planes. Huge. Which mean huge queues. Massive even. (Priority boarding as its advantages). It being almost 3 am by the time we trundled to the runway and, still being under the weather, we only had a couple of bites of the savoury hot snacks, used our hot towels, declined the champagne, turned the seats into beds and slept for almost 5 hours. We think we were both out like lights within about 10 minutes. The crew were somewhat alarmed that we weren’t eating and absolutely desperate to at least make teas and coffees when we were on approach to New Delhi. shame we couldnt enjoy the food, but the beds made up for everything. They were flat very wide and comfy.

Also, and it wasn't something I was used to, children were allowed to run up and down the aisles giggling and playing. I found it slightly irritating but an Indian guy implied that Indian airlines were more relaxed about this sort of thing than American or European airlines. He also told me, although I can't confirm this, that the Asian airlines in general had more space in Economy.

They as parents will be happy to meet you on landing and wont complaint but for their health and back sake please change the airline. They have Indian crew on most international flights now so language issue wont happen.

You would therefore assume that our seats too had been reserved. We arrived at New Delhi airport to be told they were overbooked and only had one business class sear. We argued with them for 45 minutes but they just shrugged and showed zero interest. I explained I was disabled and needed my career but they were just not interested. Take it or leave it. We had to take it and that was it. The plane was then delayed a further row hours due to a sick co pilot who had to be replaced and the flight time was increase due to the closure of Pakistan air space. The onboard crew were terrible spending most of their time closed away behind curtains doing as little as possible. NEVER AIR INDIA AGAIN.

This was the cheapest available, so I went for it. And it was a pleasant surprise. There was enough and tasty food, as well as an adequate choice of latest movies, and flying crew were efficient (on a previous experience with Jet, I had practically fainted from lack of food and low blood sugar). The choice of liquor isn't great, and the crew typically assume that if you are an Indian woman, you won't drink hard stuff and show you juices. But if you ask for it, they will give it to you. The flights are packed though--they use Dreamliners--and the worst result of that is about 30-40 minutes' wait for bags after deboarding. But this also means they allow you to fly with 40 kgs, so you don't mind. What I surmised is that baggage loading on belts is haphazard and done in a Soviet style, so there will most likely be a 20-minute gap between your two bags! (Also, enough toilets to go around, and they manage to keep them clean almost until the end.) What else do you need in economy?"

Shortly before the flight they sent an email it has been postponed a couple of hours due to inaccesibility of Pakistan airspace. My arrival time would be the same according to the new itinary they sent.

However i guess they forgot that the delay in rerouting works both to and from, because when we arrived in delhi many of us had missed our connection to Goa. And so they had a new boarding pass for me for a flight 12 hours later!

Naturally for such an extended waiting time an airline would make it comfortable to you as an excuse? No, got the sorriest curry in the airport and the smallest bottle of water a company had ever packaged. No lounge, no apoligy or even a comment. Playing it like its not their mistake..

How about the new flight then? Well i was cramped into the very back of the airplane on the seat that wont lean back while the guy in front of me was an avid leaner taking all the little space i had in these seats that already wont fit a grown man.

So in the end i arrived in the middle of the night, too late to check in at the homestay i had booked i was doomed to wait 5 more hours for the morning to come.

If thats not enough!! I also forgot my bose headphone on board and while they managed to recover it, they wont sent it but recommends me to have someone pick it up for me!
Do i know anyone in Delhi? Nope! Isnt this an airline who can handle international customers? Apparently not.

So now i have to pay their warehouse charges for months until i happen to be able to pass by Delhi again. Or perhaps just forget about the headphones if the charges are more expensive.

And thats not to mention the dirtiness of the cabin and half broken display that i normally dont mind."

I bought the ticket thru air India expecting to play with their luggage rules and realized in the airport that the operator of the flight is Alliance Air and that they only allow 15kg per passenger and 5kg of carry on.

I was just taken aback my the state of the plane...it was a very rickety flight and i’ll admit I was very nervous. We flew on several Indian Airlines and AI has to be the worst. We’re going to India next year and unfortunately we’ll be flying on AI a lot. This is because the flights are direct with no connections. However AI has one of the worst on time performance records there is. If there’s any way to book my tickets on different carrier if at all possible. Surprisingly AI hasn’t had a fatality since 2009 I think the plane was on it’s way to San Francisco when it went down in the ocean and they never figured out what had actually happened. India actually has one of the worst airline safety rankings for domestic aircraft, making it safer to fly in Pakistan and Bangladesh, hell even Air Koryo from North Korea is safer than Indian planes. So every flight I took in India was a little anxiety producing. I will say that if I had my pick of Indian domestic airlines i’d choose Jet Airways over the others."

This is after completing a 12 hour journey from Sydney on a flight with Air India.

On the day that Air India was boasting about having an all women crew on all flights originating from India, My mother and I were struggling dealing with the rash, unprofessional and unethical officials at the AI office.
This was my first and last experience with Air India
My only reason to opt for this airline was because Air India is the only flight that was flying direct, allowing me and my pet to travel together.
There were alot things that went down that day, that showed lack to professionalism, ethics, corruption and misconduct.

Firstly, my pet exporting company did not get a response FROM Air India till less than 24 hrs of travel , despite submitting all documentation more than a week ago .

Secondly , I was waiting at the airport for least 40 mins as per the advice of the baggage team for my pets collection.
After constantly nagging them for more Information, they told me to collect the cat from the cargo area without any directions provided to locate of the building.
The Air India cargo group and customs office had absolutely no idea on how to deal with the import of a pet .
There was a very obvious lack of training , and lack of knowledge of the process and protocol . All I saw was chaos and officials palming us off from one dept to another.

Thirdly , air india mucked me around for another 2 hours before actually sending me to the right dept, all I heard throughout my discussion with them was whether I have an agent as they mostly deal with agents. I assume these are the middle men who get the job done. I told them there is no need for these as ACQS India has a well defined protocol that they should be following , to which that had absolutely no response apart from ""I should hire an agent. ""
The middle men in India will follow the same process as what I did, the only difference would be some extra cash they slip in the pockets of these officials, who did not seem to want to do the job.

I was also told that the server was down for maintenance that day, and the money has to be transferred online and only using the net bank of public banks such as PNB.
The customs kept repeating that the air india was not responding .
However when my mom reached her threshold at 10. 30 pm and lashed out at the entire dept creating a ascene, the job was done within 15 mins. Air India was responding ,the server was working and the money was collected in cash .
We were given the gate pass to collect our cat and mom and I finally left the premises at 11 pm at night.

This was my warm welcome back to my country. I can only imagine the loops they make foreign citizens go through.

Finally , Air India has a vigilance dept, which provides a phone no. to report such misconduct and malpractices. As expected the number does not work.

I will of course be taking this further up and present the video evidence I have that shows all the people involved. I do hope no one else goes through, what I went through

I would not recommend anyone to use this airlines after my experience. The airline is 2.5 on a scale of 10, there are some serious concerns with the management .
I believe this is the reason they fail to secure a buyer for privatisation of this company. Every year the govt provides 1,500crore in aid from TAXPAYERS MONEY towards this management that refuses to work and lacks ethics.
I would NOT be using the services of this airline ever again even for if offered for free.

The worst experience started @ Indore Airport. On the counter, when I asked about Mr. Ashwin, ex-manager of Air India and my friend, I was shocked to know that he passed away in heart attack at age of 42, RIP. Due to shock, I forgot my set of documents including all my bookings, travel insurance, my medical prescription etc. at counter. After passing through security and reaching boarding gate, I recollected and asked ground staff that get me papers back but she straight away refused saying that flight will get delayed where as at that moment the incoming flight AI 636 from DEL has not arrived and IDR airport is small enough to get docs from counter in maximum 2 minutes.

After long haul of 6 hours, BOM-BKK by Dreamliner, AI 330. nothing much happening.

Return was like horrific. I got seat 28 A, which does not have recliner. I asked for change of seat, air hostess asks me to search a vacant seat on my own. Can you imagine that?

Then started loud music on personal music system. I and my nearby Mother-Son fellow travelers called all 2 female air hostess and one male air host to stop that but they behaved like being deaf. At a point of time we really thought that air hostess is handicapped and deaf.

It was like party all night for more than 3.5 hours on AI 331(March 2, 2019). I could hardly even close my eyes.

Dreadful food both the ways. Pav Bhaji at 2:30 am? Only AI can do it.

I felt ashamed of being Indian due to behavior of fellow indian passengers and behaviour of AI staff.

Over with my frequent flyer membership. I will drown my 20k + points accrued in sewage rather than flying AI again."

And I have a pre-booked train ticket to the airport. So 5 hours to kill at Arlanda airport. :-/
Plus, the worst is that I have connecting train travel booked in Delhi and other arrangements which I will now miss.

The flight was due to leave at 19:45.
Now it will leave at 23:55.
And I doubt the vague reason given: ""operational reasons"" is honest.
I suspect it is a cost saving reason.

I have a friend who regularly travels to India and within India who — when I informed him who I was flying with — said ""Good luck with that. I vowed never to fly AI again"". He said he had many bad experiences, cancelled flights, no seat booked when arriving at the airport, etc., although this was mostly Indian internal flights.

Looks like they are a dishonest carrier that can't be trusted to keep their paid for commitments.

My final judgement: MISMANAGEMENT!!!
I will put this complaint on social media including the ministers in charge like Aviation Minister and Home Minister.

P.S.: There is one positive point: the crew on bord was very friendly and tried everything to ease the situation of those who were in trouble because of Air India's unnecessary delay."

Flight supposed to leave at 7:25 am to Delhi from Chandigarh--didn't leave till 1:45 so missed connection flight to Jaipur. Thought we had booked a later flight at 6:30 but another botch job by Air India personnel--put us on the 6:30 pm flight THE NEXT DAY!!! No empathy or customer care in Delhi. Did manage to catch Jet Airways BUT new regulations for luggage limits (which would have been honoured because of our booking date) was not recognized by Jet Airways--they wanted R500 for each kilogram we were over. Thankfully we had a great travel agent who worked out a solution for us. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FLYING AIR INDIA TO ANYONE!!!"

Economy",This is a Star Alliance Airline?,"Look, I get it. Delays are inevitable. It's a fact of life. But nowadays even budget airlines will shoot you a text or an email if your flight is going to be significantly delayed. Air India? Not! We left our hotel in Delhi at 1 am for a 4 am departure to SFO. I even checked the flight status before leaving the hotel. Once inside the terminal, the International DepartureCheck-in/Bag Drop line was 1 hour long. They only had 7 stations open for God-only-knows how many departures. Once we reached the counter, dropped our bags, and got our boarding passes, i happened to notice that our flight was delayed until 6:20 am. I asked the agent what gives, and got a shrug in reply. Le sigh...
After another hour in the Security line, and running the Duty-free gauntlet, we got out to the gate, which was behind locked glass doors. There were ample comfortable looking chairs and even a few chaises in the gate area. Out in the concourse, there were only 60 or so miserable chairs, with 200 pissed off people milling about with a couple of hours to kill. We walked further down the concourse and found a couple empty seats and waited. At 5 am, they finally opened the gate area, and had our carry-on x-rayed yet again. We boarded at 5:45 and pushed back at 6:20.
Our aircraft, VT-ALH is a 10 year old Boeing 777-200LR, which first flew in 2009. I seriously doubt that this aircraft has had any money spent on the passenger cabin since put into service. It is just beat-up inside. Scuff marks and dings everywhere. The seat cushions are thin and grubby, many arm rests droop down to the seat. The In-Flight Entertainment system is the oldest one I've ever seen on a long haul flight, and is for all intents and purposes non functional. If you can even get the system to work, half of the functions are inop. On the flight from SFO, I had to try numerous headsets before I found one that worked. On the return from Delhi, I had no audio, period. The guy sitting next to me had nothing - Black screen. Not even the moving map was working. Pathetic...
The food? Are you kidding me? After a month of eating our way through India, enjoying the most delicious food in the world, the food on Air India is barely edible. Whatever you want, as long as it's tasteless Daal, rice, and either Paneer Curry or Chicken Curry of some dubious pedigree. The inevitable Gulab Jamun was possibly the worst thing I've ever tasted. It was kind of like chewing on a cotton ball soaked in rancid sugar water. Breakfast was kind of a weird mashed potato affair with raisins and caraway seeds, and a cream cheese croissant. Trader Joe's microwave Indian meals are far superior to the slop served on Air India.
The Cabin crew were benign, but just a little clueless. When I asked for a Vodka and tonic, the young lady whipped out a big bottle of some random Vodka I've never seen before, and poured about an ounce into a plastic cocktail tumbler. She handed it to me, and gave me a can of room temperature tonic and started to leave. I had to chide her to give me A) more Vodka, B) some ice cubes, and C) a few lime wedges. I basically told her that I would keep bugging her for more drinks, if she didn't just give me what I wanted the first time.
Basically, we flew Air India because it's the only non-stop. Next time, we'll definitely re-think it."

Shortly after takeoff a passenger fell ill and the service after that was bad if you asked for something they would say we have a crisis on board and we would have to wait.
It could not have been too serious or we would have to make a detour but nevertheless all services slowed right down for the entire flight.
The inflight entertainment was about three years out of date and a lot of the passengers were saying that the headphones were not working properly and when I tried I could not get sound up high enough to hear properly fortunately I had my own and they were ok.
The main reason we chose Air India was in the old days when you flew into Mumbai
You had to go half way round the airport for the next internal flight,but with Air India you flew into and out of terminal 2 so that was a lot easier.
On the return journey I must say that the flight was a lot better with much better service
but the food was still mediocre and and the inflight entertainment was the same poor at best."

AI126 has been delayed 8hours for departure (eta 21:30cst) on mar2nd 2019, and passengers will be notified once they arrive at the terminal (period).

If your destination is Delhi its 8hours delay, you would reach Delhi around 23pm IST instead of 15pm IST. AI126 is flight from ord-hyd with a 2/3 hours stop at Delhi. Now passengers travelling to hyd have a connection flight at Delhi early morning 6am IST, so it's a 7 hours waiting time. Top it, you got to do immigration check in at Delhi, take your luggage, walk to domestic terminal and recheck in the luggage.

We understand there is national security issues, but an airlines with so many years of operation doesn't have a backup plan/ route, Instead of making passengers suffer.

Air india Staff at ord got an extra brain too, they say it's your problem to take luggage and recheck in, as if we booked ticket till delhi and a connection in morning. Have some life staff.

Its minimum courtesy for an airlines to communicate that their flight is delayed, passengers will make alternates. I don't want to mention how little ones were at ord during the horrible check in process.

Let an extra $100/$200 go away, Better prefer some other airlines rather than an airlines run by govt."

This was no use to us as we had hotels and safaris booked for 3 days which meant we lost 2 days. We emailed and were told we could have a refund. We informed our insurers to find we were covered in some circumstances. We travelled by car instead at great cost. The second flight from Jodhpur to Goa was delayed by 3 hours with no reason given. We had to queue for ages to get onto the flight and then the seats were uncomfortable and the back of one of our seats was broken and could not be put into the upright position. Every time the steward come by she asked for the seat to be put upright before take off in a very officious manner. Eventually we got up so she could try to get the seat upright and she could not but made no apology.
2 months on, no refund had come even through for the cancelled flight, we had asked several times for the money. Eventually we contacted our insurers again who claimed the money back. Would never book again with air India."

We didnt know you had to have a return flight. Shame Air India didn’t tell us this when we booked at not whilst we were putting the bags on the weigh machine. We were forced into buying a ticket at an inflated price to fly back at a time that didn’t suite us, but never mind because the air India rep, that’s the one that was nice, not the other one with attitude assured me that we could change the date to a date we wanted and this was free. Lie number one. We couldn’t and it was going to cost us another £76 each. When we got on the plane our pre booked seats were given to someone else and we were shunted to what we were told were better seats. Lie number 2. The seats were by the toilets and we had no window. One of our seats were broken so that one had no entertainment and no food table (pictured seat). Air India’s Dreamliner held together with tape. When we arrived at our hotel, I compiled a complaint and emailed air India, this failed to send so I contacted them through their fb page, they gave me an email address that also didn’t work. When I eventually got an email address I sent them my complaint, which the ignored, of didn’t respond to. I went on to email them another 6 or 7 times using any address that worked. Still no reply. I then contacted their fb message system and raised my issues with them they thought I wanted to tell them about the broken seat so they could get it fixed, they wanted everything bar the searial number of the seat. I explained I didn’t care about the repairing of the seat because there would be no way on earth I would fly with them. Went into air India today in Goa to cancel flights as there was no way I could fly with such a poor airline. Cancelled return flight rebooked with other airline. Further more safety issues on plane, one air host sat with no seat belt on take off and landing, not a big issue I know but if the pilot is going on about safety and putting on your seat belts it doesn’t set a very good example.

From the check in desk to the flight attendants, everyone was warm, engaging, and proficient in meeting all needs. The plane was comfortable, clean had design features we had never experienced. An individual pouch at each seat, pre-stocked with bottled water, allowed us to be refreshed immediately on entering the plane. Each seat has a foot rest that can be positioned to suit you, and the shape of it allows you to massage your feet. Special baby beds that attach to the wall allowed families traveling with infants or toddlers to accommodate the child's needs brilliantly.
We also felt well cared for. Our meals were delectable and included options for vegetarians, including Jain selections. While dining we marveled at the efficiency of the delivery service. Small carts were used to quickly serve the delicious hot entrees, and coffee and tea are brought around with a pot on a tray, which seemed easier for the server and quite hospitable to us!

Ok, so the seats are not as fancy as on some airlines; but they do convert to flat beds of 190 cm length. The toilets are tiny, but I do not plan on staying long in them anyway.

The only other problem (not on the flight) was we were charged twice on our credit card for the flights, the amount they put on hold for the initial payment had not been released after 5days. I saw this on the bank statement and after contacting the airline they apologised and reversed the charge...lucky I saw it or they’d have collected an extra $1500!

How I wish we could have taken the middle eastern planes instead with a layover for a cheaper price. Air India’s flight attendants on our specific flight were so incompetent, unhelpful, and really could have cared less about their customers. People were carelessly placing their bags in the overhead cabin in the wrong ways and they didn’t check to see if perhaps they could make more room for other people’s luggages. The entertainment provided was also subpar, no new movies that just came out, and overall poor tv quality.

They also didn’t have WiFi, and while I don’t really care about this factor too much because I do sleep great in long flights, I think any flights over 12-16 hours non-stop should at least provide this option, even if customers have to pay. It’s 2019, Air India! Get with the program!

The toilets were also dirty and unkempt. Two of the different toilets I went to just didn’t look like any flight attendants have cleaned them in between. At least once take a good look at the toilet condition.

I’m always excited with long international flights and I can’t say I’ve ever had a negative experience, until this most recent flight. It was very disappointing."

The aircraft interior on the Boeing 787 was a little tired. The layout was 2, 2 and 2. Flat beds that were very comfortable and spacious but not highly technical. Films on offer were a little dated etc but what really made up for all of that was the service. It was a good old fashioned service. Not overly done like most airlines. Not rushed. You are spoken to as Sir / madam all the time. They have the upmost respect for you. The service is planned so well that it kind of knew when you would be hungry. Thirsty and then needed sleep. Very well done. The crew could be seen but not heard. I think that’s the other way round on many airlines. You normally hear the crew chatting but hardly see them in the cabin. Not Air India. I would not hesitate to fly with them again. Just one thing missing. A toiletry bad. Every airline gives you one of these. It’s what airlines pride themselves in but Air India did not give these. I had slippers and a sleep shade. It was a day flight so maybe that’s why."

Our seats were pre booked and they gave them to someone else meaning we had to sit in a row of seats that had been left un ocupied because one seat was broken. This meant the dining table and tv did not work. It was held together with parcel tape. See added photo. I emailed Air India on more than 6 occasions and to this day they have not responded. As soon as I get home I will speak to my credit card company to try and snatch the money for the return ticket. If not successful I will take action against them. All in all a disgusting airline that I would not feel safe to fly with. The staff at the hotel in Heathrow we stayed in warned us about this company but it was too late for us. Do yourself a favour.

The ground staff, then, very rudely started taking out cabin luggage and giving it to the passengers to keep under their seats to make room for bigger cabin baggages. One Mr Sunil was especially very rude. The stewards put their hands up and sated that it was the responsibility of the ground staff to see that extra cabin baggage does not come in so it is their responsibility to accommodate the baggage and if we did not want to keep the baggage under our feet we should of refused to take it from them.

Additional drinks (inc alcoholic) were provided upon polite request. Clean reclining seats, good enough entertainment system. So all the basics were covered well.
Food was good on the trip to Mumbai. Even had an awesome choc brownie on the lunch tray.

Downside, food on Mumbai to London trip could have been better. Description of food options lacking. Chose lamb, expected Indian lamb curry, got very bland lamb stew. With rice. So it's plane food as expected 10 years ago.

Biggest downside by far . . . . The online checkin is not fit for purpose. Verified the same experience by others on the flight - in case I had missed something. You may be able to easily check in as an individual - but try to check in a family, and you'll waste time. Managed to input all four family members passport details after a couple of attempts (website/page resets now and again) - then, before you can select seats, you're logged out with a message saying contact an agent to secure seats for a premium / charge. Had this on both flights to and from India. Others confirmed same experience. People who paid extra didn't get their premium seats, so the was plane held up while IA manager called in, and explained to Customers that this happens every flight, nothing he can do. No ownership, no accountability. Utterly bonkers approach to Customer Service. AI - How about this for a novel approach ' don't take the money if you know that you cannot provide the service being sold' I.e. The premium seat.
My experience at Goa airport was almost hilarious - managed to get online check in to work on airport web checkin facility a couple of hours before flying to Mumbai. Last minute to say the least. This time, I managed to confirm seats on Goa flight and print boarding passes before AI desks opened for luggage drop (approx 3 am). System logs me out. As far as system is concerned, I've checked in.
Desk agent asks - have you got your boarding passes for connecting flight to London? I ask for advice on how to do that - agent replies: by using the web checkin facility.
So we sat in different rows instead.

The snack in the morning was worst, a ice cold hard cheese roll with a cold drink no hot drink!! Didn’t touch it. Come on Air India you can do better!!!"

I'd say thefood given was definitely Economy Class food. when i went touse the toilet, thebowl was dirty and toilet paper stuck in the bowl, pointed this out to the steward, who did not do anything. i had to go in and cup my hands together under the tap there in the toilet and pour the water from my hands to loosen the toilet paper which had dirt on it. it eventually dislodged and then i had to flush it.By taking water from the tap i happened to spill some water on the floor, which i tried to wipe up and then i went out and called the steward to point out what i had done to clean the toilet bowl and that some water was still on the floor, so he grabbed some toilet paper and wiped the rest . then only, did i attend to my needs. so much for that."

The flight leaves late in the night and arrives to Newark in the morning which is great for folks to get to work even if it's late. Our flight was delayed for couple hours and I would not have minded that but the reason was waiting on luggage from another flight to arrive. Everyone was a little puzzled why they were waiting for luggage when all the passengers had boarded. But that small hickup didn't bother many since most of us were falling asleep.

Having read the reviews I was dreading the experience. I had my antibacterial wipes to clean the seat area properly - so low were my expectations.

In total I had 4 flights on their 787 business class. Each was on time, or early. Service on EVA is impeccable, but somewhat sterile. On Air India they treat you like a guest - maybe not as polished service, but more genuine.

Compared to reverse herringbone seating, which is fast becoming the norm, the Air India cabin is very open in a 2-2-2 layout. A nice change.

Food was pretty good, but served as a single tray. Plenty of drink choices.

IFE was not great.

The biggest disappointment was the state of the interior of the planes. One was only 1.5 years old. Already shabby. On a 10 year old EVA it is still factory fresh.

The airline delayed my flight from Singapore to India, so I couldn't fly from India to Paris. When I arrived in India, one of the flight attendants was very calm and said, ""Your plane has already left,"" and I was so embarrassed and bewildered. And I went up to the person in charge and I talked about this, and the Air India said they could fly the next day, and they said they'd be able to provide the hotel by the next day. But I planned this trip with my friend. My friend also came to Paris from Korea alone. I didn't want to waste a day and kept asking the flight attendant. I said I wanted to board the fastest other flight, not the next day, but Air India kept telling me to wait. I waited for about three hours and asked the Air India representative again. My flight ticket was going on, but the person in charge asked me to wait again, asking me why I didn't buy the ticket. I felt like I had to wait until the next day. I bought the ticket myself and notified the person in charge. And the person in charge told me to wait and see. But I suspected it, and I told him again.Gaga showed me my ticket correctly. Then the flight attendant got annoyed with me about why he bought the ticket. And he told me I had to make a visa for delivery. The tickets I bought at that time were from India Delhi to Mumbai and Mumbai to Paris. But what I'd like to say is that if I had informed me before I bought this ticket, I would have thought about something else. But they didn't give me any exact information, and I had to pay to make a visa again. And I asked him about the refund process for my ticket, and he told me that he would give me a full refund if I sent him documents and emails. I've always wanted to deal with this problem in Paris, and I've been sending emails, but I'm just saying, wait for it. If it wasn't for the airplane problem on my trip, everything would be perfect. But because of airplane problems, I got a lot of stress and ruined my trip. The next time I have to go to another country, I don't want to use Air India again. Air India is really a delay-based airline, and there is no substitute for the guests on the Delayed flight. If the moment comes when you have to choose Air India, I hope you'll think again. Don't choose this airline if you don't want to be in the same situation as me. I spent 600,000 won on this trip because of airindia."

On deplaning we were asked to travel along a long corridor without anybody guiding us where to go. After walking for quite some distance we were asked to stand and wait ( no seating available)for opening of the gate to a hall as the key/security person was not present. Our documents were checked twice before entry. Thereafter, we were made to wait for a long time without adequate seating arrangements, then stand again in a long queue for another documents check, whereafter we went through a security check again for entry to the departure area. It was such a cumbersome and tiring process.

Was getting ready to hear an earful on how bad the flight was- but surprise, surprise..SHE LOVED IT! She said the seat had some issues and entertainment wasnt upto the mark. But she loved the fact that the food was so Indian, and there was a ""real coffee' served when she needed it. She was all in praise for the flight attendants who helped with everything she asked. She also said that they served real yogurt and that the food was nothing short of amazing.

Mind you- she is no one time traveler. She traveled many times before, traveled in Emirates business class before. And now she prefers only Air India (even over and above Emirates' flights). I was pretty impressed that she was happy. Here is her comparison to the experience - am putting her initial feedback on Emirates as well to get a perspective:

Checkin process- Airlndia (4), Emirates(4). Would have loved to not to wait for wheelchair (guess this is because of the airport)

Seating process/preflight experience- Air India (4), Emirates (3). Air India hostess apparently walked along with her till the seat, while the Emirates person just directed the seat.

In flight entertainment- Air India (2), Emirates (5). Air India's entertainment was very bad and she didnt find anything good enough. Apparently- some of the passengers complained that their entertainment didnt work.

In flight dining- this is where Air India trumps over others. Air India (5), Emirates (2). Coffee and Yogurt was real good :) . Hindu Vegeterian was super.

Help from Attendants- Air India (5), Emirates (3). Flight attendants actually wrote her customs form!! I loved this part too.

Most importantly- she also loved the fact that she didnt have to stop over in Dubai and experience ""rude"" staffers. Am not surprised to listen to this myself. I had encountered similar rude behavior myself in Dubai (yes, even in Business Class- the wheel chair attendant and the lounge attendant forgot to smile and wish in Dubai!!)

When we attempted check-in we were told abruptly (and contrary to the assurances given previously) that the flight was closed and we would not be able to board. End of story.

Air India's ground staff were utterly useless, passing the issue from one inept/disinterested colleague to another. No apology was given, no attempt was made to offer a refund or a re-booking and we were left to fend totally for ourselves.

Thankfully, the on-site concierge of the very excellent Leela Palace New Delhi (Air India's customer service teams would learn alot from them) were able to negotiate a comfortable road transfer from IGI to Jaipur, meaning that our lengthy trip to Delhi was not wasted.

Air India has improved in flight timings. Cabin cleanliness is good, Seats are comfortable. Food was warm and tasty.
My observation about the Crew serving and attending passengers, is that they do not seem to be satisfied or happy doing their job. None of them ever smiled, stiff actions, tight lipped. They were good at service but passenger friendliness was missing.
Still I feel Air India is the best Airlines as of now, except tariff on few routes should be more economical."

The entertainment unit didn't work right on the return flight. I only selected Air India because they had non stop flights from the US to India. Big mistake. The worst part is when I was sick and couldn't leave my hotel room for a 2am flight they made me purchase a new one way ticket to get home. NO change fee- a NEW ticket. Horrible airline with horrible policies.

The boarding was by row numbers, the gate staff were quite effective in handling the boarding. I had the boarding pass on my mobile, that worked well at the gate. For all other major domestic airlines, there's an option to print/reprint the boarding pass to go through the express security check , but Air India is totally paperless, if you choose to do so. This is only for the Passengers with carry on bag. I had no bags to check-in.
The flight was comfortable, the onboard service was courteous and professional.
Air India is now one of the very few airlines to serve dinner for all on board for free, irrespective of the ticket class , if you are flying dinner time.
Though not a fan of Air India, I would give them the due credit for this flight !

The issue that I have experienced is in disgust at the level of no service from air India at all.
My parents left for a flight 02.02.19 in Business class from Heathrow airport, which they paid a lot of money for. £4000. The service on board was TERRIBLE. The TV didn't work, headphones didn't work. There was no complementary toiletry bag, in general the service was so bad, the hostesses were all rude and not very helpful, especially when assisting an elderly lady on board at trying to find her medication. It had dropped on the floor but none of them helped her look for it and then said she left it in the bathroom!!!!
My Mother dropped her phone at the side of the seat, someone came to assist her get it out but then said he couldn't and walked off. Another lady came an hour later and pulled it out.
The fact they paid £4000 for this experience is a rip off and disgusting behaviour from the staff and company. I should expect a good will gesture of part refund for this flight.
Also, I called your customer service to make a complaint and even the person on the phone was rude and had no customer service skills at all.

I have since made a complaint on your website and through Resolver, however i have not had a responce from either.

I would avoid this airline at all cost - the fact that no one has replied to me with even an appology just shows what kind of an airline this really is!!!!!!!!"

We were flying to HYD the next day and sure enough we were told our bags would be delivered to our hotel in HYD. Three days later the bag was delivered with a minimum of 3 calls a day to either Bombay, Delhi, or Hyderabad Air India baggage services. The bureaucracy, lack of communication, and transparency is befuddling. The only saving grace is that they allow 25kg for checked baggage.

Had booked this flight quite a months ago so got a reasonable return fare of 19K for three persons in economy. Also Air India has been running this promo of payed upgrade offer to next available class at just fraction of the original fare. Like we had the option of upgrading to business class for just around Rs 2K per seat which is quite a deal. But yes this is limited to seat availability.

The flight was an early one at 6 AM and the check-in was smooth at Delhi International Airport. Luggage was tagged and boarding pass given. Security check was quickly done and we were ready for boarding on time. In fact the flight started 5 minutes earlier. Take off was smooth with no events.

Seats were standard A320 seats and comfortable for short flights with comfortable leg room. One this that annoyed was that there was no pouch to keep small thing behind the seats like small water bottles, papers etc. This is a common feature which is found in all other A320's flying in India.

Breakfast was served after half an hour. Food was just average not quite spectacular nor too bad. Service was quite efficient and on time.

There was quite bad turbulence while the flight was half an hour to Chennai which is kind of scary. It persisted for around 20 mins and then smoothed out.

It took around 2:30 hours of actual flight time to reach Chennai and not including the tarmac time. Even though we reached before time the luggage took quite some time to arrive which is quite annoying for an International Airport like Chennai. But can be understood that this is govt controlled airport unlike in Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore.

Overall a nice flight with Air India this time and would definitely try them in future."

We happened to check about a week before we flew in order to deal with seat allocation, but found that the flight appeared cancelled.
No word from Air India.
It had indeed been cancelled, we found out, because 26th January is India's National Day and for a few hours EVERY YEAR Delhi airspace is closed.
WHY ADVERTISE A FLIGHT THAT COULD NOT POSSIBLY TAKE TO THE AIR?Especially as this happens on the same date every year!!
When contacted, they said we had been rebooked on a 7.30 a.m. Flight. When told that we could not physically make that flight, they more or less told us, tough luck and because we rebooked you, no reimbursement.
Are they totally incompetent, uncaring and useless? Or just unbelievably cynical?
After the hassle of this, a couple of days later, they belatedly sent a bland e mail advising that the flight had been cancelled......BIT LATE AIR INDIA!!!
We ended up having to re arrange our schedule and went from Chandigargh to Delhi by train.

Boarding started only a few minutes before the departure time, passengers became impatient and started pushing and shoving as there were no lines. The aircraft was in dire need of repairs, torn seats, non-functioning audio/video system, and smelly restrooms. Cabin service was a typical example of government employees dedication - cold food which they themselves would not care to eat, very poor response to passengers' genuine requests, etc. There are plus points also--the timings are excellent, especially the arrival time in Delhi.

It just makes so much more sense to give out the seats in a serial order when several people are travelling together.

Yes Sir India is also known for competent pilots..but Air India is known more famously for flight delays and rude air hostesses.

That it has held tight to its signature trademark low quality and poor manners...in an era of suave air hosts and budget flights option is a miracle..truly amazing.

We had arrived early at the airport as my ageing 80+ mother who has been traveling for the last 60 year always does..we always get to the airport hours early.

Throughout our lives, this early to airport, early to check-in/Immigration has kept us healthy and wise. It has helped ensure us smooth check ins and general stress free airport journeys.

This time however I had had a fall and was in a wheelchair. An urgent trip came up. My elderly mother has been in the wheelchair for sometime now. We both needed assistance. My little grandson accompanied us.

At the entrancee of the flight we were suddenly asked to walk by ourselves to our sear despite there being a host of air hosts standing right there. We pleaded for assistance. Which was conveniently ignored. Both my mother and I are tiny small people..not tall or obese at all..

Further...as we fumbled inside the flight...we all 3 of us had been assigned different seats...this has never happened in any other flights before.

We were not helped with our in-flight luggages till I begged and pleaded the very able bodied airhost.

One healthy looking stewardess snubbed us saying that she has backpain and cannot carry the 6kg luggage. Someone so ill should not take this as a hosting profession.

This experience was pretty similar to that Air India Express we once took to Kuala Lumpur. Lousy flight...lousier air hostesses.

In this competitive age, to survive please hire people with good interpersonal skills.

Air India and Air India Express, neither are you cheap nor clean nor friendly, learn a thing or 2 from Indigo and Jet Airways, my top choices for Indian flights .

All in all I will hopefully never fly Air India again.nor recommend it to anyone."

The seats are horrible on the aircraft, the entertainment system was ""not working"" in certain rows, the USB charging port was missing (there was a hole in my seat where the USB port should have been), and the food was disgusting. Air India has been caught carrying meals inbound from India and warming them up instead of loading them on from European destinations in order to save costs. This has led to stale and expired meals on return flights, which happened to me. Air India stands by this policy of carrying meals from India for return flights but clearly, its causing issues for them and they're in a state of denial. Flight attendants could care less about your problems and aren't even interested in doing their job properly. Overall, this has been my worst flight experience and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING this airline at all costs. Pay the extra bit of money and fly with other airlines to India.

Firstly, they brought forward the flight by 5 hours from Delhi to Dharamsala without telling us. We were in transit from Australia so even if they told us we won’t be able to make it anyway. Than the show of ‘go to this counter and then to other counter’. After a huge protest they booked next day flight and gave us a hotel. Really substandard hotel. Wasted our day. On the way back they cancelled the flight at last minute when all the passengers are sitting at the airport in Dharamsala. Again after a protest as we will our Singapore airline flight from Delhi to Australia, they sent us in a taxi to another Airport two hours away (Pathankot). Flight there was also delayed but we end up making our connection. Staff is rude, inconsiderate and don’t care about the guests at all. Typical public service. Don’t use this airline and if you do than expect last minute delays, horrible service and substandard food.

I won’t even give them a rating so it’s a zero out of ten from me. Just disgusted by this experience."

The flight attendant Tarek was extremely rude to me and would not serve me at all. I have never been treated so badly on a flight before- it actually made me sick to my stomach. He was extremely threatening to me- I asked for a glass of wine and he denied me. He told me to “not treat him that way”. I pay money for this service, and to be treated as if I am a second class citizen. I will never ride Air India ever again- you have officially lost me as a costumer and I will make sure no one ever wants to ride Air India again. I will waste my time posting a negative review on ever site I can- that is how upset I am. There is a group of men next to me who are being extremely loud and the fight attendants are no doing nothing about it. They are making kissing sounds at me, yet when I tell the flight attendants they tell me to just ignore it. I expect to be treated with respect when I’m on a flight, and am truly disgusted that you hire flight attendants like Tarek who treat people like second class citizen. I am so disappointed in this service- I truly hope no one ever has to ride Air India again. I will write a bad review on ever site so no foreigner has to go through what I went through. I read the poor reviews and still trusted this airline- what a mistake on my end. I will ensure no American will be treated this way by warning people before they decide to book with you.

Flight left a little early and arrived a little early. The rest of what I write applies to business class only. Service was attentive. During the course of this long flight, two full meals were offered. In addition, sandwiches, alcoholic, and non-alcoholic beverages were available. If you select your meal in advance any dietary preference can be met (Hindu vegetarian, Buddhist vegetarian, Jain vegetarian, Halal, gluten-free, etc.). Otherwise, meals are Indian with a few western options. The food is good. There is a curtained off section in Business Class for women living in seclusion.

First and business class travelers have access to the Virgin lounge which is very nice.
The advertised flat seats are not quite flat and my controls were balky. However, they are comfortable enough, there is a lot of leg room. Real duvets, not those skimpy airline blankets, and comfortable pillows are available for sleeping. I would take this airline again.

The second flight was from Kolkata on a Boeing 787, also business class. This is a wonderfully comfortable airplane. The food is Indian--vegetarian or non-vegetarian, and good.

Business class lets you board and deplane first and your check-in luggage comes off the plane first. These are big advantages in crowded India.

The flight to Newark ( EWR) is about 15+ hours, nonstop from Mumbai. The aircraft was not packed to its capacity, so there was some flexibility in storing personal items near the seat. Also, the toilets were easily available all through the flight. The food was served as per our reservation request. The food and the service was decent. I liked the red wine. The onboard entertainment did work and it was helpful to use it between the sleeping laps. The seats, once fully reclined ; were comfortable enough for sustaining this long haul flight. The cabin temperature was bit cold, but with blankets on, it was cozy.
The flight landed a bit ahead of time at EWR on a brilliant, beautiful, sunny morning of New Jersey winter ! The immigration was swift and by the time we came down to the baggage carousel, our bags were on the belt!

My experience didn't change at all this time as well. The flight from SFO to Delhi departed 40 minutes past the scheduled time, though everything incl. boarding was done on time. When it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure time, the captain informed us of the delay due to some commercial reasons. I wondered what stopped him from informing us of this earlier. They have the worst in-flight service compared to any other international airline. Most of the LCD screens are malfunctioned. Some didn't work at all. The selection of movies, shows etc. were so limited and mostly outdated. The screen resolution would remind of 90s experience.
There is no organization shown by the in-flight crew. Some snippets from the plane - People would stand by their seat for an hour or so every few hours ; couple guys would stand in the pathway , chatting for 30-40 minutes. Not to mention that it created so much inconvenience for fellow passengers to go to restrooms ; group of 3-4 guys would stand by the kitchen and restrooms for couple hours and chat casually. Surprisingly, I saw couple crew members joining them as well ; Some people in their seat would never stop chatting , though it was late night. The entire thing felt like a typical Indian fish market.
I had a connecting flight with Air India to Chennai. Since the SFO flight was running late, I inquired with the crew members about the connecting flight status. Some said it won't wait for us and some said it would. After we landed in Delhi an hour past the scheduled time, I ran towards the connecting flight gate. The flight was still there but I wasn't allowed to board it. I had 3 other folks who were going to Chennai. We were put in another flight that left 3.5 hours later. Of course, the drama didn't end yet. This flight was scheduled to leave at 7.55 pm IST. It was 8.15 pm and there was no announcement on the status. There were two AI staff members at the counters. After I inquired about the status , they made an announcement for the ongoing delay. We boarded the flight 45 minutes past the scheduled time. While we were getting off the plane at Chennai, one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry-on bag in the restricted overhead compartment. Most of us saw a crew member putting it there since we ran out of space. So unprofessional. My return flight from Delhi to SFO saw another hiccup. This time they delayed the flight because 7 passengers couldn't come on time due to a delay in arrival from Mumbai AI flight. Remember how I missed the domestic flight earlier and I was told that 300 passengers couldn't wait so they had to leave without us. But they could delay the international flight for a delayed domestic flight. Such theatrics could only be seen with them. This is the first in my experience. They let down us again with horrible food (no seasoning and bland). Refreshments were barely edible. I would say it was the worst food offered on an international plane. The fish market was back in action. The in-flight entertainment deserved black and white movie award.
I am no Aviation Industry expert. But I can promise one thing- Give me the operations job for 6 months and I will make sure that this airline meets the basic international norms.
Indian Govt. and airline industry should take a serious note of this and possibly stop their operations until it's improved"

The bags are checked through to EWR or JFK or SFO or O'Hare as the case may be. This is a smart move. But then the connection time is important.
The flight was delayed by more than an hour and we ended up having only 45 minutes to transfer ourselves in Mumbai into the Newark flight. Thanks to the immigration done in Chennai, we managed to be at the gate for EWR almost at the last minute. But it was a big sweat ! Thus, it's not a good idea to take this flight from Chennai if one is connecting in Mumbai onwards to EWR.

After take-off we were offered lunch which was probably better than Economy but not as good as I have had on other Business Class flights. There was wine and other beverages on offer with meals although not showing on the menu. After that it was unclear what further meals were to be offered. For some reason they offered supper about 4 hours out of Sydney which seemed to me when most people would have been wanting to sleep.

We left Goa almost 2 hours late after scheduled time. We were told that we wouldn't lose the connection because the plane that we were going to fly from Goa would stop in Mumbai, get new passengers and continue direct to Delhi. When we arrived to Mumbai we were surprised as they told us to go out, together with another passengers to the counter E and check in again. We already had checked in back in Goa. We were running all the way through the airport to the counter. They changed our tickets and surprise! We run back again to find out that we went back onto the same plane. We left Mumbai delayed, probably because of so many passengers running around the airport. Later, staff told us that the plane in Delhi to Copenhagen was going to wait for us because we were around 10-15 people going on the next flight. The plane to CPH was supposed to leave at 14 and we landed in Delhi at 13:35. When we came out from the plane there was an operator waiting for us to guide us fast through security checks etc. to the other plane which was waiting for us. We went all together and the surprise was that everyone boarded and we were refused. They told us that our names were deleted from the passengers list. The staff could not tell us what happened or why did it happen, claiming that it must had been in Mumbai where they thought that we won't make it on the CPH plane. We looked at the plane from departure gate, leaving the hub at 14:43. That is when the nightmare started. The staff at the gate told us that our bags haven't even arrived from Mumbai due to the fact that we were deleted on the list. We spend 8 hours at the airport trying to solve our problem. Air India staff were rude when we asked for what happened, lazy to answer our questions lacked of professionalism. From the staff from the gate (4 people), we were pushed to another group of staff, then another staff and so on. They didn't admit the mistake they have made moreover, they claimed that we were late for the plane and that's why we lost it. We were fighting with everyone trying to get the true and they were sugarcoating us all the time. We were not the only ones at the airport with similar situation to ours. They even didn't want to give us hotel to spend the night. After fighting a lot they gave us a really bad and disgusting Hotel. During all day we were with no food and no water.

But this particular flight was very disappointing, due to several shortcomings. First the onboard entertainment system didn't work for all the 3 seats, we were in row 38. For over 2 hours the crew tried various tactics, nothing worked. So, we had to either forcefully sleep or eat or just sit tight as reading a book was not an easy option with overhead lights, for the next 13 hours. So boring it was ! Next, we had pre-booked special meal ( AVML) long , long ago while the tickets were purchased, but the crew told us that they ran out of Indian food, and offered us pastas and some vague stuff. We refused the offer. We told that we were willing to go hungry, but then somehow they pulled out 2 trays for us from somewhere. Next, on a 15+ hour flight, the crew never offered Coffee/Tea except the occasions of lunch/dinner. I had to walk up to the far end of the aircraft at the back to the pantry area to fetch the coffees. Then, unfortunately, the passengers around us were talking loud and were constantly eating something or the other such as Khakraas etc which they brought along with them , passing it back and forth between the seats making a mess of our seats. The crew never intervened to advise them to be calm.
The drinking water was not a constraint as the crew had kept a few bottles in the midway pantry areas, all left for the passengers to fend themselves.
One of the few positives, the toilets were generally/ periodically cleaned up.
The check-in at Newark was a mess, though the airline had a couple of staff regulating the queue. We had done web check-in, but it took a while to figure out the dedicated counter for web check-in bag drop, that did save us tons of time.
Despite the stressful time those days for the TSA staff with shutdown running into 4th week, they handled the security screening swiftly, efficiently and professionally.
The flight took off a bit late at EWR , but did arrive in Mumbai on-time. However, the arrangement by Air India at Mumbai for transferring the passengers to connecting/ onward flight was pathetic. It took almost an hour and half after landing for us to get to the lounge.
Overall, it was a very disappointing experience.
I force myself to patronise Air India, being the National carrier of India; much as every Japanese is proud to patronise JAL or every Korean is proud to fly Korean Air , or every Singaporean prefers Singapore Airlines , and so on with almost every national carrier.
Wonder whether Air India ever be a world-class airline and would ever invoke that pride of being the carrier of India ??"

Now today when I reached Airport i got to know that the flight has been cancelled with so and so reasons and there is no scope to board an alternate flight. Also to add to the Shameful behaviour of Air India, they asked me arrange the for my own Cab and refused to pay for the same as they will refund the ticket amount.

Air India took no responsibility of the helpless situation we were put in due to abrupt cancellation. The passengers were by their own! As I was running out of time, I quickly boarded the Airport taxi for which i am going to pay 4000.00 INR and yes i will get my total refund of 2381.00 INR by Air India.
This Horrifying experience cost me a fortune, wasted my time and left me in total frustration. I will never book a flight from Ludhiana Airport specially with Air India.

I was traveling from Jaipur to Delhi, Delhi to JFK flight. My Jaipur - Delhi flight was on a separate PNR as I booked it later however we spoke on the phone at the customer service and was told that our luggage can be allowed from Jaipur itself since we have a connecting Air India flight within 12 hrs.
I was carrying 2 pcs and one poster roll separately. I was told at the counter that my luggage can be checked in uptill JFK in Jaipur itself.
First the guy at the Jaipur counter told me that I will be charged 1 pc extra. I said, Okay I will just pay and get it done with. After going up to the other counter I learnt that the charge will be for 240 dollars. I was shocked, I thought might as well leave it in Jaipur itself. I went back to the counter to negotiate and they agreed to send all of my stuff as the total weight was also coming within the permitted limit. I felt very thankful and thanked the staff in Jaipur for the same as they checked my luggage in till JFK. I am a 23 yr old girl and was travelling alone. They were really generous towards me.
My flight was at 8.10 pm from Jaipur and Our flight was delayed for 2 hr 45 minutes. Next flight to JFK from delhi was at 1.35 am (on time).
I reached delhi at 11.00 pm and rushed to Transfer check in counter for my boarding pass. There were three people sitting and all were as usual getting yelled at by the frustrated passengers. I waited, I was ensured by the staff that everything will be smooth for me.
All of a sudden, A staff named I think Mr. AVIDESH YADAV, (extremely RUDELY) insisted that I need to pay 240 dollars or else they will not issue me my ticket!!!! He was not ready to listen to me.
I was taken aback, I asked him as to why am I being asked NOW, I should have been asked in Jaipur itself, coz then I would have left the paper roll (Had I required to pay that much amount). I told them it’s just like a poster roll. They were not even ready to take the roll out as it was already checked in. He made me feel as if I am lying. After fighting and arguing (when it was not even one hour left for my JFK flight) I had no option but to agree because they told me they will not give me my boarding pass. I was sent to the other floor (the main departures floor) where the lady sitting on the last counter, don’t remember her name. Extremely ruthlessly told me, without even listening to me, that I SHOULD FIRST CHECK THE TYPE OF MY TICKET.
I have never dealt with such a rude staff. They claimed that Jaipur staff is different, I told them that you all represent Air India. And why am I being asked now 40 min prior to my flight. I was crying because they harassed me so much. They said that I need to pay or else I will be not allowed to enter the flight. They told me I AM AT FAULT THAT I GOT TICKETS DONE LATE AND NOT ON THE SAME PNR. I AM AT FAULT THAT I DIDNT INSIST THE JAIPUR STAFF FOR A BOARDING PASS THERE AN THEN (which was not allowed obviously).
I paid 240 dollar plus tax, INR 17950 rs.
40 min before boarding pass was issued. I was rushed and entered the flight 30 min prior departure.

This is complete cheating. They took advantage of the situation. Made me pay because I had no option. I wanted to leave that poster roll. But my entire luggage was checked in uptill JFK. Air India lacks internal coordination. They asked for money for a small piece of roll.

I ask them, how can they compensate for the time wasted for 3 hours when my flight was delayed due to technical issue in the aircraft??! And the rush and stress created because of lack of time between my flights??!
I was going on a 15 hour flight after that, imagine my state of mind.

They were completely UNAPOLOGETIC.
I extremely disappointed in the staff attitude.
This is a genuine feed back and an action must be taken immediately."

At my first stop over I was told we had to switch planes which originally was meant for Mumbai but now brought us to Delhi with connection from there to Varanasi, my final destination. I’ve flown to India in the past and noticed a similarity in the ticket where I only had an hour to get from one plane to the next but I was told I had to go through security get my bags, line up at air India get a new boarding pass again then get on my flight. I knew this was impossible so I asked the clerk if there were any changes I could make, with a grin on her face she said, you’ll have to deal with it in India. Upon reaching Delhi (where I was never meant to be) I made it through to the gate just as they were closing only to be told that I was late and just like last time, had to buy a new ticket (at no fault of mine) out of pocket if I wanted to get to my destination. When I asked about my luggage they went on the plane and got it for me.. makes sense ya?! At this point they had no other options for me to get to Varanasi so I was stranded in a city I had no intention of being at and had to make all new plans fast or else miss out on the rest of my travels. Long story short, took me over 46 hours to reach my destination which I ended up taking a train to after being stranded in Delhi, a city I knew nothing about.
Considering this has happened twice, and friends have experienced the same thing.. if you’re a tourist, air India will book your flights very close together knowing you’ll have to buy a new ticket never offering new flight options, help or reimbursement for the flight they were responsible for getting you to. Horrible service, horrible situation..
do not fly air India."

I was told at check-in that I could not check in until I had cancelled the flight from Kolkata. I went to Air India reservations to do that and they told me that I would be fined, and that my ticket to Birmingham was now invalid and that I would have to buy a new one. In all they charged me about £400 and told me I would not be able to board my flight until this was paid. I was appalled, though i recognise that I should have notified them that I would not be using the Kolkata-Delhi part of the flight. There threat to leave me stranded at the airport struck me as unethical and questionably legal. Many travellers would have maxed out their cards after three weeks in India and would not have been able to pay this,
So I have paid twice for the same flight; Delhi to Birmingham. And I have paid a fine for not using a flight I had already paid for though not used."

Business Class",The worst experience in Bus Class on ANY airline,"The captain of the aircraft asked for feedback. I offered that feedback to the airline on their site and they never replied. So, here is my review for all to see:

1-The planes are so old that sockets are falling out of the seat and the seats don't work properly.
2-Seats are somewhat broken and really uncomfortable
3-No amenity kit
4-No menus
5-Flight Attendants get angry when you can’t hear them whispering to you and you need them to repeat what they say 5 times - raise your voice a little and perhaps we will hear what the heck you are saying.
6-No decent movies or about 15 to choose from if it even works
7-Low Def TV screens on these planes are not even worth the trouble of turning them on.
8-The screen off button doesn’t work. It comes on several times per minute and then shuts itself off. It has a mind of its own because they were not making any announcements.
9-When I looked around I could see not one screen showing anything but the orange screen and for 15+ hours!
10-Lower your expectations very low indeed - Bus Class on this airline is about as good as Premium Coach on most others.
11-Service is abominable. They don’t check-in with you unless you stop them while they walk by or hit the call-button. They walk by all the time without asking anything
12-Airport people in Delhi were obnoxious when Coach was boarding and we asked where the Bus Class line was. The man basically ignored us for even asking and waved us off.

Don’t bother with feedback on their site because it’s pretty obvious they don’t care. The feedback people must be overwhelmed or overcome with feedback because they don’t even respond.

And of course, no WiFi!

Never again. Never will I step foot in one of Air India's planes for a long-haul or ultra-long0haul flight and I hope you don't either. It's absolutely the worst."

So Air India have the dream liner and this is where the experience stops. Check in and boarding were not a problem. Plenty of legroom though the seats were not very clean. The middle seat next to mine was broken which doesn't bode well for the person sitting in it for a 9 hour plus journey. The entertainment is second rate - the Hollywood movies were supposed to be the latest and were in fact 2-3 years old. The stewardess, serving us, on the flight out looked like the most unhappest person I have ever seen. Everything was too much trouble and nothing was done with a smile. The food serviced wasn't so bad, was hot though a little too spicy for me. Don't get fooled by the easy transit through Delhi when you land. Surprisingly you still have to go through security again. Not sure why and again not sure why this process takes so long. People in the security queue were panicking as they had flights to catch and none of the airport staff seemed to care. All in all don't expect too much from Air India and you won't be disappointed."

Plane was comfortable and clean, good luggage allowance, friendly staff and decent food - I ordered vegetarian. Luggage came out super fast on both ends. In Tel Aviv we had a bus ride to the plane across the tarmac. It seemed to take a long time and go round in circles, with us all squashed on the bus. Strange. Maybe it was getting us ready for India ! Was about 20 minutes!! Anyway, apart from that minor detail, wouldn’t hesitate to take that flight again."

Getting off the flight worse than boarding, especially when you don't understand that they have opened the back of the plane for deplaning as well as the front.

The Airline decided to wait for one passenger before going, which resulted in a 1h 10min delay upon arrival in Frankfurt.

Because of this we missed our flight to Copenhagen.

Now the nightmare begins..
We went to Lufthansa Service point who tried to figure out where we should go, only to find out that Air India apparently hadn't rebooked our ticket for a later flight. After waiting for three and a half hours the woman from Lufthansa had to give up, and told us to go to Air India or simply just buy a new ticket.

We went down to the Air India counter, and the guy there said something like ""I tried everything but now that you are here I have to try again"". Getting gradually more frustrated we still calmly tried to explain to the man that it is the Airline who has the responsibility to get passengers on the next available flight and he responded that the problem is that we bought the tickets online?? WTF. After 'trying' many times and continously trying to blame us saying something like it was a problem that we originally had paid our tickets in Danish Crowns, some other guy finally managed to fix us a flight almost five hours later.

This company is so extraordinary unprofessional and you will not have a reliable trip travelling with them.

Bonus: an Air India employee scammed us in Delhi airport and took out our luggage from a connecting flight, only getting us back in if we bribed him 1.000 inr. (I didnt make a review about that before now since I was on holiday)

There was no issue with check-in and boarding; the staff behaved well and there was a serving of tea & coffee with cakes, biscuits and sweets--all at free of cost which we missed badly during our return flight by Indigo Airlines. Their staff were polite in their demeanour but offered us snacks, tea and coffee at a cost (exorbitant); nothing was served free except a cup of drinking water! This really matters as and when their flight gets delayed due to bad weather or technical snags and passengers have to remain stranded long hours prior to boarding. Besides, their flight-fare is comparable to that of Air India. If Indigo pays due attention to this strategic issue i.e. become more professional by serving free snacks & coffee/tea to its passengers without any extra charge, their business would definitely boom. I have listened to many passengers alleging this lapse in the basic service(which may hardly cost @Rs. 100--150/- per ticket) which certainly won't eat away their profit margin rather would pay for."

When I exited the first aircraft I was informed by ground staff that if I won’t make the connection they will put me on the AZ 407 flight at 18:15. However, the Air India counter at the airport absolutely refused to do this and claimed they “could not get in contact with Alitalia”. Then they put me on the 21:55 Lufthansa flight to Rome- causing me to spend over 6 hours in a layover at Frankfurt (three times what was originally planned). This completely ruined my bookings in Rome for the 11th and caused me great discomfort. Additionally, the counter representative was unnecessary rude, it was clear he didn’t care to help at all, the Lufthansa representatives were more helpful!

As someone flying business you expect a small kit of amenities - however they didn’t even provide passengers with a basic toothbrush.

Food was of very poor quality. Not inedible but I would advise you to take a small packed meal for the journey."

Our friends looked askance when we told them of our choice. All proved wrong. The flight was great and the service was very good. We have travelled with several airlines in the past around the world but we would say that Air India is now our preferred carrier.It cannot beat Singapore Airlines !! But then there are no airlines to match that one!!! We are thinking of going to Canada in the near future and we would certainly consider AI as a first option.

From Pune to Delhi is a domestic flight and I take care if immigration and stuff at Delhi airport which saves time. It reaches early morning at SFO so I get time and I reach back in India around 10pm which again helps me with a good sleep. Regarding food, you will get Indian food so good for me. Somehow cannot understand the beverage service. They serve liquor when you are about to reach SFO. I think they should change the schedule. At times you might face issue with toilets as the fellow passengers do not understand that they cannot throw anything there. There could be challenge with your entertainment unit and you might not get to see anything throughout the flight. Seat's neck rest does not work (none of them). So if you are looking at saving time and the timing of arrival is important, take this flight. Else there are many better options."

I mean come on! that is just, well sad. It's like the age old example of how Indian Government employees work to serve themselves.
At one point a flight attendant needed to cross the queue and instead of saying something like ""Excuse me"" she said ""Tsch Tsch!!"" and waved her hand at me to move like I was a prisoner standing in queue to get my grub.

Well, the next amazing thing was the plane itself, an Airbus 319, 11 years old which isn't that old by aircraft standards. but the cabin looked like the last time it was cleaned was 11 years ago.

With the name AirIndia (you'd assume it's a flagship airline for the country), you'd expect somewhat of a good experience. The nonstop flight from JFK to Delhi had no working TVs. The seats were broken, dirty and just plain disgusting. I asked for water 10 times only to receive it the 11th time. I missed my opportunity to purchase business class however the seats for business are palpable for what you get with the amount paid for in this airline. I would avoid this airline at all costs. Only silver lining is that on the way back from Delhi to JFK the staff was a lot more tolerable and the TVs worked. However, there were brown smears on the seats, broken and just disgustingly dirty seats. I will say, the legroom was nice - but still a very terrible experience. It's no fault to the staff however because their air planes are probably the worst-maintained of all airlines I've flown. Next time, I'd fly Aeroflot. Never making that mistake again. Also, during the screening of packages in India, they missed a power adapter and withheld my luggage in India for 2 days before releasing it.

Once we were airborne I asked an attendant what arrangements were being made for us with the connecting flight. I was told was that we would not make the connecting flight and that all arrangements would be advised to us once we had landed, by Air India staff.
There was no information once we had landed.
It turned out that there were approx 50 of us in a similar situation. Air India had at least 6 hrs before we landed to organise something for us.
Our bags had been tagged in LHR to go all the way to Goa and we were told that there was no need to go through Immigration until we reached Goa. Instead we (50 of us) were directed from the Transfer Desk to Immigration back to the Transfer Desk and then back to Immigration. Where we then had to pick up our bags and rebook ourselves onto the next available flight with Air India.
Communication by Air India was dreadful, to say the least. We just kept being passed on to someone else.

While timings suits me the best all other factors leave much to be desired.Cost wise no longer competitive with likes of Spicejet flying on this route with 20% lower fare.inflight meal Delh-HK is terrible with soggy spring rolls and cannot have more than a bite.11.15pm flight, passenger checks in at 8.30, has left home at say 7pm why no Dinner??Then at least give a heavy snack.The food tray is worst than a domestic flight 9f a normal carrier like jet airways.Inflight entertainment is never changed and for last 3 months have seen same menu.Indian music with 'oldies' or Ghazals is not there at all.

So should I be flying Air 8bdia only because it has the good timing that suits my schedule? Have to think about it.Another thing..Sir India was always generous complimentary upgrade and about 2- years back I could count on at least 2 upgrades every year incl international routes.But not any longer, I have not got an upgrade for over 3 years inspire of the fact I see empty seats in business class.

Further the only good feature to mention is that thecFrequent Flyer Program has recently got very active.However still more needed.For eg in Jet on any overseas flight 24-48 hrs prior to flight an offer for upgrade is received but even if there are offers like 'bid for upgrade' it should come in the mail before departure else you leave it to us to open website and try to do it.Pkease make all this customer friendly.Hoping for better days ahead"

We had flown this airline many years ago but the standard seems to have continued to deteriorate. The staff were overwhelmed, they did not have a basic selection of soft drinks, the cutlery (plastic) was missing from my son’s meal and by the time we got the attention of the staff, his meal was cold. There was no blanket on my seat, and I did not even bother trying to let the staff know as the 8 hour flight would likely be over by the time I did. Would unfortunately never recommend this airline."

On the way back on 4th January we got to check in and they had allocated us seats that were not together, even though we had checked many times and had email confirmation that flying as a family we would, at worst, be 2 seats together and 2 seats together elsewhere. They sent us the seat numbers by email so we were happy with the seating plan. The check in staff at Air India said nothing they could do, one of our seats was broken. They had put my 5 year old girl sitting next to a random passenger on a 2 seat together configuration. After much protestation they told us, nothing they could do and to sort it out with the passenger on board and see if he would move seats. Unbelievable, since we paid around £7000 for what was meant to be a treat after working hard all year.
We embarrassingly asked the passenger if he wouldn’t mind moving, which he wasn’t best pleased about. He didn’t really have much choice when there’s a young family looking at him! The chief steward assured him he would be on his own with no one sitting beside him as the chair was broken next to him. Within a few minutes someone else got on and this extremely rude steward sent him to our ‘broken seat’. When I protested and said ‘why did you tell us it was broken, caused tension the whole of check in and made another passenger feel really bad uncomfortable’ , he basically shooed me away like he was swatting a fly away. How he is the chief steward I will never know! I didn’t want to make a scene for everyone else on board so had to leave it. Completely ruined the trip home.
Flight AI 131 - Mumbai to London - 0700 hours - the steward really needs retraining. The power of being in charge of the business class cabin has seriously gone to his head!
I wouldn’t recommend flying Air India and will try and find the extra funds to fly with a different airline.
If it wasn’t for the flight on the way out the ratings would’ve been 0!"

I asked to change seats due to the obvious safety concern and was told the flight was overbooked and given a jump seat used by the flighy crew.

We had to pay twice for our infant's tickets because their system is really messed up. They refused to acknowledge we bought tickets and blamed us for not having one. Check-in times were 1.5 hrs at SFO and 2hrs at Delhi airport not counting the time spent in queue. The staff is so untrained and unprofessional that you'd end up doing anything to just take the flight out, like we ended up paying twice for the same ticket. In case if you still decide to take this airline, make sure you reach airport a few hours early so you have enough time to spend at check in if you end up like us.

Where do we start? Checking with Air India takes for ever. How can a simple process take so long for every passenger compared to other airlines? EasyJet excepted?
Flight departure was delayed as we were advised it arrived late into Delhi. Was departing from gate lounge 7 but then was shifted to gate lounge 26. Now that is a cut lunch away on other side of terminal building. Flight boarded one hour late. Once airborne settle in for the flight, watch a movie, etc. to fill in the time.
Touch screen did not work, entertainment system slow to respond from hand held controller. Then went to plug in head set the plug socket was broken, no sound. Great!!! Middle seat between us would not stay fully up. Pressed attendant button. No one came and then just reset. Tried again, still no one came. Michelle was not going to use her screen or head phones. We swapped seats. Three guesses, same problems, seat plug broken and head seat also missing plug end. Again, tried to get flight attendant. Then I noticed a lot of blue lights around me, obviously many others were having problems. Then they rebooted the entertainment system. I obtained another head set and managed to get some sound by jiggling the headset in the socket hole. Sound was very soft and mono sound but had some sound but kept falling out if bumped.
The rest of the flight was uneventful, food is not great, some staff appear to have some attitude that they are better than some of people on flight. If want a drink, have to go and find one as very limited service to seated passengers.
Toilet paper, seems to be Indian thing and have to bring your own as none in toilets 10 minutes after seat belt sign off. We did bring own as had this experiance before on previous Air India flights. Toilets are not maintianed during flight so imagine how it is after 10 hours, no soap, no hand towls as probably used as toilet paper, etc.

Overall it was not a cheap flight and there is an expectation that the aircraft is serviceable. The 787 Dreamliner is not old aircraft so one has to wonder if the internal passenger equipment does not work and or is not maintained, what about the important bits to make sure we arrive safely at our destination.
Lift your game Air India as there is plenty of cheaper and better airlines occupying the same routes."

Very rude behaivor of all people on the counter as well as the manager in duty I called.

The check in was fine and the staff were very helpful. The flight itself was uneventful and very short so no issues at all. We were not expecting much in terms of food and beverages. The plane itself appeared to be reasonably new as you could smell that new leather smell of the seats.

Full refund received after a few weeks but no compensation and no help with getting a new flight. New flights were £500 more - does it seem unreasonable that this is not good service. I booked the flight in May 2018 and paid for the tickets in full.

I am so accustomed to delayed flights and even canceled ones, that I was especially happy about the service. I have a criticism but I don't think it relates to Air India and more so to the baggage handlers at JFK. The plane was very large and thus there were loads of bags. Handlers began offloading bags off the belt and making lines of bags that were hard to navigate and it took me 45 minutes to locate mine because of the chaotic situation. It would have been so much easier to leave the bags on the belt and let customers take them off as they rotated around."

They also weren't the full pods which I have seen in other business class international flights so you didn't have quite the same privacy.

The screens, due to the set up, were a bit far away from you making watching movies not quite as enjoyable, and the quality of the screens was a bit on the lower side. They did have full AC charging, but no in flight wi-fi on my service. Overall it was a great experience relative to flying coach, but compared to flying other business class airlines it wasn't special.

I would probably choose a different airline if you get the same price point. When I took Air India, it was about $5000 cheaper than the only other option I could book (given my works restriction on airlines), and it was definitely worth saving the money. However when booking personally I found some other airlines similarly priced which were a bit nicer.

Staff was extremely friendly and attentive, I thought the food was okay (better than coach food, but not as good as other business class food I have had)."

It was a little difficult to sleep since the staff was serving food or drink and you can’t keep your chair on an incline because it disrupts the food tray.Seats are cramped and the only saving grace was the entertainment that helped to pass the time. I do believe I may have passed out for a 15 minute nap due to exhaustion. The return trip was delayed over an hour and for some reason we were sent to security for another bag search. The return trip had a broken entertainment system but I was able to change my seat or it would’ve been torture. I would most likely pay a little more for more comfort.

We were booked to travel on Air India's new Dreamliner aircraft and had booked three seats on both the outward and return journey from Singapore to Chennai instead what we got was their much smaller A320 aircraft. Furthermore and much to our annoyance we discovered that on our return journey we had not been allocated three seats together. When we phoned Air India about this their advise was that in order to travel together we would now have to pay an extra fee. In view of this we felt we were being cheated by Air India who we believe were actually in breach of contract given we had already reserved and been allocated seats for the return journey.

Train journeys are becoming difficult because of his incontinence. So we were happy there is a small airport near us(It's called Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport. I have mentioned Kolkata in my review because there is no option of small airports in TripAdvisor)It would take less than 2 hours to reach Delhi. However upon reaching the airport we came to know that neither the airport nor Air India had arrangements for a boarding ramp. My son is extremely scared of being transported at great heights on his wheelchair. It's not only dangerous for him but also for the airline attendants who carry such heavy persons on a wheelchair up the flight of stairs of the boarding stairs. So he opted instead to be carried in his father's arms which was equally dangerous for him and his father. The stairs were steep and many in number and by the time his father reached the top, he was breathing heavy and exhausted. Now his father is able to carry him, what will happen when he grows old and can no more carry him? I appeal to #AirIndia and #AviationMinistryIndia to look into it and kindly provide boarding ramps in all airports of India. Thankyou
If this matter is solved, Air India can be worthy of 5 stars as all other services were good."

But in return they asked us to cancel the tickets and book a new one which was costing 10 times more. When we asked for accommodation they directly refused to that and said they won't do anything. Disappointed we had to protest for the whole day and only after that at about 10 in the night they agreed to give us accommodation and an additional flight at 5in the morning."

In spite of the terrible reviews people give, Air India's flight 701 on that day was on time and sufficiently pleasant. Great food was served, there were in flight screens even on the 2 hour long domestic route, and legroom was fantastic. I did not like the continuous instructions being played on the PA system on how to operate the toilets and window dimming buttons on the Dream Liner aircraft. That seemed unnecessary. Otherwise, the flight took off and landed on time, and the crew served me pretty well. I had a tight connection with SWISS within a few hours, so I was really relying on Air India to get me to Delhi T3 on time, so I could make my onward connection to Zurich. They didn't let me down!"

Air India cancelled the flight without any prior intimation. The reason stated was baseless quoting the fog and climate conditions at shirdi airport which was completely false as the other airlines were operating same time. I experienced least compassion and courtesy towards the passengers by the AirIndia staffs and there was no alternate arrangements too at the aiport lounge by the airlines. My advice to fellow passengers is please never ever trust AirIndia to book flights to Shirdi. Spice Jet and Indigo are little better in keeping up the commitment.

Upon checking in, I quickly learned the weight restrictions were almost impossible and not fairly implemented. I took photos of bags that were larger in size than my carryon, yet those made it on board. I even had to through away my yoga mat in order to make the weight.
The boarding process was well don, but as I boarded the plane my heart sunk in utter disbelief. The aircraft has not been kept or cleaned well. After all, the plane overnighted in Newark and I wondered why my tray table had coffee stains, etc. What made the experience worst is that the person to my right appeared drunk so much so he staggered out of his seat, almost fell, hit me in the face with his right hand trying to brace himself and then threw up by the bathroom door.🤮. The person to my left same row seemed to have had dimentia or Alzheimers bc he kept trying to touch me but the lady traveling with him was monitoring him, but it took a turn...
The food was good, but for those who don’t like spicy foods, this will not work at all.
The seats are horrific and the interior is again not kept well. The TV monitors did not work for me.
The highlight though was to my right, one row back from me. This 2 year old boy wailed the entire flight where he would calm down for a few moments, followed by more stretching screens. His mother tried so many methods to calm him, but she too occasionally would holler and strated hitting him out of frustration. By the way, he kept on hollering just as loud.
This was a 14 hour flight in economy. I recommend if you are not flying premium or first class on Air India for this particular flight, expect the aircraft to be untidy, not the cleanest, and uncomfortable and a subpar representation of the culture, people and country of India. It just does not add up and I’d rate it one because I made it from Newark to Mumbai without needing to be admitted.
Seeking another return flight one way back on another airline, hopefully the one I have a credit for. I just can’t do that again and okaybwoth forging the remaining value on the ticket.
By the way my flight from Mumbai to Hyderabad is delayed an hour. It has to get better and it will."

Business Class",Air India Business Class from Washington Dulles to Delhi is Economy + Mediocre Service + a Flat Bed,"I travel frequently for business purposes by Business Class. It is more than 20 years since I traveled by Air India. Since they have started flying non-stop to Delhi from Washington Dulles, with excellent time slots (1030 AM from IAD reaching Delhi at 2PM and return at 130AM reaching IAD at 630AM), for a decent price, I thought I should give it a try. Non-stop and time slots were too good for me not to try.

I have to say if one is looking for a flat bed and a non-stop flight, it is fine. If you are interested in little more for your money, such as a one or 2 fine alcoholic (wine or liquor) drinks, good food presented well, attentive or prompt service, it is not your airline for business class trips.

On my way back, after a domestic travel, I reached Delhi airport with enough time to board the plane at 1AM. After providing a soft drink, nuts in plastic packets and two unappealing appetizers, there were no offers of any alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks or food for another 7 hours, only to be woken up in the middle of the sleep for a breakfast!! Yet another shocker was ‘alcoholic drink service’ starting 2 hours (12 hours after take-off) before landing at Dulles (early morning, time for breakfast, I suppose!) and a ‘standard’ lunch following that. Unless one is a hard-core alcoholic, you will not find many who would drink the mediocre alcoholic beverages they were providing before landing in Dulles early morning.

It looks like those who run this airline have no clue about international business class travelers. Flight attendants on this segment were equally clueless. Surprisingly, I had much better experience with Air India domestic service (in fact much better than most American domestic flights). Air India definitely should seek help from those who have basic knowledge about international business travelers and could benefit from their excellent time slots and non-stop flights from USA."

Crew were professional. Luggage was booked through to Kolkata.
Just to compare we flew the same route on our way to Jaipur on Jet Airways. Cramped flights on both segments and in addition, a small propeller aircraft from Delhi to Jaipur. Luggage couldn’t be booked through, and had to be collected at Delhi airport and loaded through to Jaipur.
Will opt for Air India whenever possible!"

At one check in at Goa the agent realized our layover time in Mumbai would not be enough for our luggage to transfer or for us to make the flight. The agent quickly and efficiently put us on a flight with another airline thereby ensuring a smooth transfer back to Air India. We are so thankful to this agent as he saved the day for us.
We were served very tasty meals on each flight and along with excellent service.
However, the support system i.e. Air India app and website are difficult to maneuver, simply don't work and seat selection consistently not honored or changed - even when we paid extra to upgrade seats - that money is lost.

In addition, most flights were late or delayed with one being delayed nearly two hours.

So I would caution anyone on selecting Air India until their website is brought up to the basic standards of any other airline."

Economy","Bed bugs, delays, lost luggage, rude/inattentive crew and personnel","I flew Air India for the first time this November due to their affiliation with the Star Alliance. I typically have great experiences with Star Alliance members and, having been to India before on United flights, expected about the same level of service. I was woefully mistaken and fully regret my decision. Flying with Air India turned my trip into a hectic, stressful, nightmare of a journey from the very outset.

It started in Dulles (IAD) airport where I checked in. The desk agent confirmed my bag had been scanned for the flight. Shortly thereafter we board the plane, and it is very old and very dirty (Boeing B77W). I don’t mind older planes, as long as they have been maintained, but this one was filthy - crumbs, dirt, and trash everywhere, bathrooms unclean. Everyone boards on time and it looks like we will depart soon. Then about 30 minutes goes by, and the captain comes on to say we are delayed because some people that checked in haven’t boarded and they can’t find them. Which I actually thought was very considerate, as I have missed flights and connections in the past and know how that feels. Cut to an HOUR later, and still no one is showing. At this point they have delayed a transcontinental flight with a hundred or more people by over an hour.

The rest of the flight was OK, the service was rude and no one answered any of the service calls of the people around me, but I was comfortable enough.

The flight arrives in New Delhi and I go to retrieve my one checked bag for transfer to my domestic flight. Waiting, waiting, waiting. There are 4 others from the same flight waiting with me as well, our bags never show. The bag claim/handling staff takes us aside and it is clear they are thoroughly disorganized. They have no idea where any of our luggage is, and try to tell my my bag is probably still in the US, even though I know it was at least scanned through Air India for my flight from there. They have us all fill out forms, and then proceed to tell us NOT to put the value of our luggage down in Rupees. That struck me as odd so I pressured the staff as to why and no answer. Definitely reminded me of the general corruption that can surround these affairs - it was highly unprofessional. Luckily I had plenty of time to make my domestic flight after filling out all the claim forms, but 3 out of the other 4 people that also lost their bags were not so lucky and missed their connections. Overall, a completely incompetent handling of the situation.

My domestic flight was fine, and I was ready to get my work week started. When I checked in at the hotel, I gave the concierge the info on my lost luggage so they could follow-up with the airline for me. I also gave it to an admin at my office who was kind enough to follow-up as well. “It will be here on the midnight flight” they were told. But no bag the next day. “It will be here on the 6pm flight” they said, but still no bag. Cut to 5 days later, and multiple calls to the airline by multiple people with always the response that my luggage would “be on the next flight”. At this point I’ve lost hope of seeing it again. I depart for the airport after checking at the hotel one last time.

Side story to all that - the 2nd night in my hotel room (5 star international hotel in Pune in a junior suite) I found a BED BUG. Judging from the reactions of the staff, they were very surprised this happened. They quickly changed my rooms, cleaned all my laundry, and sent roses up as an apology. Now I have no way of proving whether the bed bugs came with me from the plane or were in the room to begin with, but my instincts tell me it was the (again, very dirty) plane...

On checking in for my return flight to the US - one of the agents takes my carry-on and weighs it and tells me it is too heavy to be a carry on and I must check it. Knowing exactly how that went the first time, I adamantly refuse and offer to take weight or of my bag and transfer it to my backpack so it is within the weight limit. The agent then tells me that while I was arguing with him about checking the bag HE ALREADY CHECKED IT and printed the bag tag so I had NO CHOICE but to check the bag. I insisted on picking it up in New Delhi and he told me I would just have to recheck it there. Truly awful customer service. I picked up my bag in New Delhi and I’ll let you guess whether or not I checked it again.

My domestic flight from Pune to Delhi was again delayed, so I barely made my connection to get back to the states. Thankfully I boarded just in time.

My flight back to the US from Delhi was on United, and it was such a stark difference to the journey out, the contrast was truly astounding.

Here’s the finale - I get back to the US, switch on my phone, and it’s a message from the hotel. The airline finally delivered my bag. 5 days later. After I had already left the country.

So in summary, this was the worst overall experience I have had with an airline - consistent delays, lost luggage, rudeness - with the added bonus of a (unproven, but probable) bed bug infestation. Not only should Air India be ashamed of their shoddy operations and customer service, but they are a mis-representation of the Star Alliance brand. They really don’t deserve to be a part of that network. If you do end up flying Air India, good luck and I sincerely hope your experience is better than mine. I, for one, will never be flying with them again."

Check-in lines at Indira Gandhi airport in Delhi were enormous, and people had piles of luggage. Fortunately a fellow passenger suggested that I ask an Air India attendant if there was a counter for senior citizens. There wasn't, but she allowed me to go to the vacant Business class counter, with the result that I was able to check in and clear security in record time.
The plane left 15 minutes late, but it didn't matter because it arrived 10 minutes before schedule. It was a full flight, so there was no question of being able to stretch out on two or three seats. I got a bit of sleep sitting in my seat, which gave me plenty of legroom but I wished that the seats were a bit wider and somewhat better padded. What was a bigger problem was that several problems on the television monitor did not load. I wanted to watch the progress of the flight by following it on a map. But, as one of the flight attendants informed me, owing to a glitch that program was not available on at least 200 monitors on the plane. I thought that it was incredible that thought the staff knew about the glitch, it had not been fixed before the plane took off, but said nothing. At least the plane suffered from no more serious mechanical problems. It flew smoothly, maintained its altitude and direction steadily from what I could tell, and made a good landing.
Airlines feed you at odd times. Our flight was no exception. I got served meals and snacks a number of times. The food, while not inedible, was perfectly unmemorable. I cannot recall any dish that stood out.
Mercifully the lavatories remained reasonably clean throughout the flight, though passengers did strew bits and pieces of paper all round.
Would I fly Air India again? It seems that when it comes to flying Economy, most airlines are fairly alike. Only two companies fly nonstop between New York and Delhi, Air India and United; and choosing between them is like choosing between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. So, in answer to my question: Why not? But not very happily."

We travelled from Washington Dulles to Delhi(Air India# 104) and then took AI#849 to Pune. We came back to Washington Dulles from Delhi(Air India#103) with Air India. Except the flight attendants on these two flights and i should say the food that was served on AI#104(outbound from Washington Dulles), everything else was horrible.So, the food served from the flight leaving Delhi(AI#103) was bad.

The seats/interiors were similar in condition to what one would find on a local bus, that many people may have travelled or seen in India. Poor condition sums it up perfectly.

Keep reading for the worst is saved for the last here :(

While returning from Pune(AI#850) our luggage was checked all the way for Washington Dulles(via Delhi: AI#103). First their computer at Pune airport had some issue and it was not able to read the perfectly fine machine readable passports that were read with ease at almost all other airports, including at Delhi. So, that checkin at Pune took more than an hour and multiple agents!! Poorly qualified workers.

To make things worse, when we arrived at Washington Dulles(Nov 4,2018) by AirIndia(#103); one of our brand new American Tourister baggage was completely torn and damaged. The ground staff initially mentioned that this damage is very common!! So, that was his response when i as a customer complained about my damaged luggage. On further discussion, he mentioned that though he is wearing and Air India badge he is not an Air India employee!! He mentioned that he worked for Delta and that he acknowledged that Air India is poor when it comes to damaged baggage compensations!!
Well, i opened one claim for the damaged bag at the Washington Dulles Airport and that was 4th Nov 2018 and today is 25th Nov 2018; i haven't heard anything after that. This is a cheap reflection on the service standards that exist in India even today especially in the Airline business. Air India should close if it has to operate like this and cheat customers and operate the way it is currently doing.

Travel with this airline at your own risk as i would never use this airline. Nothing, on the ground, seems to have changed with this airline except may be the press and media management."

I am used that flight companies will not inform you. But Air India was great they have send me a text message, an email and they rang me to inform me. Wow I do not mind any delay but it is good to receive a message to tell you so.

The check in and boarding was also very good. The staff was very nice and the food was also great. The chairs on the plane where a bit old but for 1 hour flight it was fine.

Overall yes would recommend them they are doing a great job."

But although the Airport Authority of India did not have any problem with it, Air India restricted me from going out of the New Delhi Airport and quickly forced me to do the Security checking for the next flight.
I had chosen this unclean, untimely airline which serves stale food only to use the transit time to meet my friends at Delhi which did not happen due to them. By the way, I'm an Indian citizen myself. So, whereas all the other outside Airports/Airlines allow the transit travelers to go outside in case of time gaps, it's only the problem of Air India.
On top of that, the Customer Care did not pick up the phone and their website did not allow a seat preference before that."

I then tried to use the button to call the attendant. That also did not work.
My next flight I received my luggage back cracked. A hard case suitcase. I didn't even know you could break them!
I attempted to notify the airline about my damaged luggage. I got the run around. I called the customer service line and they said to take it up with the desk at the airport. I was at the desk for over an hour attempting to have this taken care of only to have them tell me that I need to address it when I arrive back in the states. No attempt what so ever was made to improve my experience. My final flight back the ""next"" button didn't work on my touch screen on the TV so I could only watch the videos on the first screen. The tray was dirty with the previous customers dinner and there was lollipop sticks and candy wrappers in the seat pocket. I think on the 15.5 hour flight they came through offering beverages once...
Direct, reasonably priced flights compared to other airlines but expect nothing to work and it to be filthy. And don't expect the flight attendants to do anything to improve your experience."

They have somehow managed to make a new 787 Dreamliner look like an old 70s Boeing by using very cheap materials inside. I don’t know they managed it, but they did. Obviously no interior designers here.
I am aware that this airline has big financial problems, although it’s no excuse to make the passenger feel like they are in a second rate plane.

The infotainment system is cheap, even business class had a very small selection and a very small screen (it’s a new plane). Business class food is upstaged by economy class on Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Etihad and Malaysian to name a few and the facilities onboard are dire.
The only saving grace is that they are part of star alliance, so you can use partners lounges instead. United airlines was very good

This poor service also extends to the ground staff who it seems are more interested in their mobile phones than assisting the paying passengers. This really is terrible.

The only saving grace I would say is the cabin crew, they try their best with very poor equipment and do managed to serve you with a smile.

Sorry if this feels like a rant, although I really wouldn’t be recommending this airline to anyone. If you must fly with an international Indian airline, go with Jet."

The seats did not function properly- the gentleman next me was required to move before takeoff as seat was broken.

The pre-flight drinks were non-alcoholic. I found out later that the flight was dry because it flew over Saudi airspace (the last time I checked other airlines only suspended service in the airspace- which takes about 1 hour to clear).
The dinner was a mediocre curry with a yogurt in a container like you buy in the supermarket in the States. There was no beverage service offered except water. And obviously no appetizer. If the food was this substandard in business, I wonder what they tossed out as food for the masses in coach.

Back to the seats. When it came time for sleeping, I learned that the flat bed could not accommodate a six foot person (I am 6’1”). It was damn uncomfortable- I had get in a fetal position to get some zzz’s. I was not sure whether my seat was short because I was in Row 1, which is the bulkhead. I asked the gentleman behind me who was about my height and told me that he likewise had slept in a ball.

The entertainment system was difficult to extract from its stowage between the seats. It was much more difficult to put back without getting out of your seat to monkey it back in.

The attendants were professional but not particularly friendly. I am not sure if it was cultural. My biggest complaint- which I hesitate to mention- is that they made a racket for about an hour after dinner service when I was trying to sleep. A lot of cabinet door slamming and moving of shelves. It sounded like a kitchen. It may have been just a lousy design for the plane buildout as I did not see sound damping walls like in other Dreamliners.

On the subject of Dreamliners, this particular craft looked a lot older and more used. In fact, if I did not recognize the large windows, i would have thought it was a 767.

There were some nice things. An offering of PJs with the Air India mascot on it. Socks. And a nice toiletries bag."

The food was pretty terrible but the flights were all under 4 hours so just the fact that we got something on the plane was already great.

Either way I do recommend that you fly this airline if you have the opportunity to take them throughout India, of course there are better boutique airlines out there but Air India does the job and if you are lucky enough to get one of their 787 then you are in for a treat.

Economy",Excellent Airline,"Very good airline, Even for a short flight food is provided, the leg rooms are so good just like international airlines.. I travelled nearly 50 countries but for local flights Air India is the best compare to low cost budget airlines. Visited five times in three years always on time . Love to travel again and will take international destination further but this airline should make changes in their website very difficult sometimes to multi stop book, It is really funny and annoying compare to other airlines.. need improvement in this regard.
Even they should consider for international traveller changing to local flight should consider for one , two kilo extra luggage . i have been charged for one extra kilo.
Thanks"

Tall husband had to sit sideways with his legs to even fit in the seat. Good thing it was not a long flight. Would not fly them transatlantic."

The service in Business Class is excellent. They bend over backwards to assist. The food is quite good even for a non-curry-type-of-person. I had a new plane going over and an older one coming back. Both worked fine.
