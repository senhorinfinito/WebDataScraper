The area was busy and space was limited. Overall, it was really nice and far better than the one available in Delhi airport.
On the trip to Delhi, I could not ask for better service. The stewardesses were amazingly attentive, I dont think my glass was empty in 14 hours. Food options were really good too. Airline PJs were a nice addition available on my way to India but not on the return. There are about a dozen okay movies to watch in English (take your own headphones). Great experience with the staff on the way there.
In Delhi, the luggage took over an hour to get to baggage so I could go through customs which caused me to miss my connection. I later learned that you should mark your luggage as 'priority' if your layover is less than 3 hours in India. The gate staff gave me the runaround sending me to all associated desks to have my ticket cancelled/ripped up, terrible system by the airlines and airport. Though the new ticket was very reasonably priced, the customer service desk staff was slow, lazy and not very helpful to myself and other customers which also caused me to miss the flight 2 hours later. I was stuck in Delhi's lobby for over 12 hours and it was not a nice experience. The check-in staff was very precise on not taking your bag outside of the 3 hour window which was very annoying.
The smaller flights were fine in India, decent service and food with comfortable and clean planes.The return flight from Delhi back to Chicago was not nearly as good but still enjoyable. I only experienced Air India for my trip in India but work fly with them again and recommend it."

I am vegetarian and no milk products so I choose, that option but to my surprise they told me they had run out of vegetarian and instead tried to offer me cheese sandwiches which I could not eat anyways. To my understanding and other flights if I select and particular meal or service that means it should be a priority that is the whole reason it's a package. I was very disappointed and to top it all there air hostess passed me twice as I tried to get her attention and I could not find a button to flag for assistance.

So the first thing they did this very day was to call and inform me that the flight was rescheduled from 1300 hours to 1430 hours. I din't know why until I got to the airport and saw myself. This was helpful in that I din't have to go to the airport. They also sent a message to inform me of same and also updated same on their website.

Why this flight was delayed? From what I saw, the flight almost flew to Delhi with an empty cabin, Passengers were sparsely seated with more empty seats. Nevertheless, with this there was the opportunity of free-sitting.

As expected, the take of was smooth in the beautiful weather and refreshment was served almost immediately. If you read my review of this same flight from Chandigarh to Mumbai, meals are usually vegetarian meals, and this was not an exception!

Unlike other flights to Delhi we did less than two hours, more than thirty minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time.I could't tell if the pilot went faster.

Again, there was no flight update at all. I wondered if the pilots had slept badly the previous night or they had a quarrel with each other in the cockpit, which is what usually comes to mind if flight updates are not given.

Overall, it was a beautiful flying time, in a clean, modern aircraft.

Then the pilot did a great job with a short and almost unnoticeable take off. In a very long while I haven't seen such a short take off of a passenger airline.

My problem was first, with flight updates. There was none till we reached Mumbai and we were about to land, I like flight update, before take off, during, and before landing.

Second, the food served on Air India is always vegetarian which I feel should not be. This a commercial airline, not just for Indians so foreign passers like me have no damn business with whatever any other passenger eats on-board. I should receive the ideal value for my money and this includes giving me a meal of my choice and not coercing me to become a vegetarian. It makes no sense to me. There should be vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals for all."

I was offered no refund, no exchange... and told I should have known the rules and I can ""go book another flight on my credit card""... leaving me stuck in kathmandhu for over 3 days. Offering no compassion for the situation.... marking me as a ""No Show"" and telling me I had 30 minutes to go back into the city to the air India office before the closed to try and resolve the issue, which I did and was offered no remorse or help.

When I arrived for check in, I was told there was no seat at all for me! After waiting and stressing for 15 minutes, they found a seat right at the back of the aircraft in the middle section. (I had pre booked a widow seat).

I accepted the seat I was given, but after take off, realized the in flight TV did not work. The attendants were too busy with other matters to help immediately and when they did, they could not fix the problem. So I had to sit and stand, next to the toilet for the next 12 hours to Delhi. This was one of the worst experiences I have had with this airline.

My return flight was not a great deal better. I did get a window seat, but when I boarded, there was an elderly woman sitting in my seat. I asked the attendant to sort it out, but they just said, chose another seat. Finally the woman moved, as she was totally in the wrong row.

Again, the TV screen did not work properly. The touch section of the screen did not work and the headphones were dodgy and I had to hold the connection in throughout the flight. One thing that was unusual was the lack of a physical safety briefing before the flight left Delhi.

I found the flight attendants on both flights rather poor. I have been flying with Air India for some years now, but I think it is time to change. One of the best things about this airline is that it flies direct from Sydney to Delhi non stop."

I saw several other airlines taking off punctually while my flight was delayed for several hours, no reasons given, no announcements made. The cabin crew misled me by telling me that my connecting flight will wait for me. The cabin crew also misguided me by telling me that my checkin luggage will directly go to Mumbai whereas I had to collect my luggage in Delhi and re-checkin it again. They even directed me to the wrong area instead of the travel desk. The ground staff in Delhi was also NOT helpful. I had to find the travel desk on my own by hauling my luggage around. I managed to catch the last flight to Mumbai. I will never use this airline again."

There will not be enough leg room. The in-flight entertainment will be regularly interrupted by PA announcements (23 times on this flight, only 2 of which were necessary). Air India achieve all of this, but also find new ways to make it unpleasant.
For the two weeks or so before the flight I received numerous emails notifying me of schedule changes which, when I checked, weren't (except that we unexpectedly arrived an hour ahead of schedule and at the wrong terminal).
Despite reserving seats in advance on-line three times (the third time paying extra for the privilege because the for some reason the first two times were over-written) we were given non-adjacent seats at the very back of the aircraft at check-in.
Our boarding passes were checked no less than separate 13 times before boarding, and luggage x-rayed three times.
Boarding is chaotic and no longer done by row. That does not really matter though because, being India, no-one waits for their row number to be announced anyway.
Despite the aircraft being a Dreamliner, so relatively new, it was tired and scruffy inside, with plenty of stains and broken buttons. And it smelt, nasty.
The free issue headsets are useless, but that does not really matter because the choice of movies is very limited and there is no music available. Bring a book.
Flight staff are, let's say, ""abrupt"" and despite being asked to elaborate on the menu options could only repeat ""veg or non-veg"" but louder. (""Non-veg"" was chicken curry, as it turned out). Bring your own food. (And ear-plugs too if like me you dislike the sound of fellow passengers smacking their lips as they eat)
Within a few hours of departure the toilets looked like they had been hosed down with dirty water (I mean seat, floor, walls, everything). And that is every toilet on the aircraft.
On the plus side, Indian's don't generally drink and so have no idea about serving alcohol. I asked for a whiskey and was given a plastic cup full to the brim. I mean, about 200ml of whiskey. So I slept well."

- It was a small Aircraft Aurbus 322 used in domestic flights (3x3seating)
-Not enough blankets /pillows for all passengers (It's so unprofessional )
- There is no in-flight entertainment system
-Quality of plastic plates used in meals is pathetic. The finish of plastic bowls was 3rd grade. Can't be a part of international flight
- Not enough food choice for foreign nationals

The seats are quite comfortable compared to the other domestic airlines, probably the best. The legroom and the personal space are also great. But unfortunately, I cannot think of any other positive aspect about the flights. The staff (ground as well as in-flight) are nonchalant and indifferent, no choice of meals, flights delayed during departure. On the DEL-CCU flight, the food was served in a container made out of crush-able aluminium foil, like in the Indian Railways, and the container was half crushed. But even after all of these, the seat comfort is what actually made my flight not-so-bad.
Just yesterday, I read the news that there are no takers for a stake in AI, but I feel that if this airlines is managed a little more professionally and with a pro-customer mindset, it can turn around and be the best airline in India."

After booking I read the reviews - note to self... get the sequence correct next time.... and I have to say I think on balance the reviews i read were pretty accurate. The outbound overnight business class was, in my view, poor and I’m not fussy or pretentious about it... just wanted a decent service and be able to sleep. The food choice was limited, but nice - but the demeanour of the cabin crew wasn’t great. Not offered any more drinks, help, assistance or such. The recline-to-bed seat isn’t long enough for a 6 foot tall person, and, when extended consists of missing sections of cushioning which makes it very uncomfortable. I resorted to trying to alleviate this with a doubled over duvet as a base and a thin sheet to keep the AC draught off me. Courtesy bag didn’t have earplugs nor eye mask, and, they don’t have them even when asked for. For something costing less than a quid this is shocking in my view. All in all a pretty unpleasant flight ; the domestic business class transfer is barely premium economy.
Having said all this..... the return from Delhi to UK was a different experience.... staff were extremely attentive, helpful and pleasant. Food was a lot better too I’d have to say.
Delhi Business Lounge
- domestic : was “ok” but food wasn’t great though managed to get a few things to tide me over. - international : better facilities but atrocious food,,,, COLD sliced potatoes and omelette....
brought in a dominos pizza in and was asked why.... so I told them... still they didn’t seem bothered...

It’s business class.... but not as you know it. It was much cheaper, and, perhaps thats the obvious retort - but not so cheap that it couldn’t or shouldn’t be done a lot better than it is."

After arriving at Singapore we waited till all passengers alighted as we had asked for wheel chair.

By 5:45 or so, the flight status was changed to Departure at 09:30AM. Later, around 7:30 or so, I got an email saying that the flight was to take off at 10:00AM. By 10:00AM, there was absolute pandemonium created by the Air India staff! Apparently, they told some passengers that the flight was canceled. Needless to say, other passengers go the wind of it through grapevine and not directly from Air India. The situation was totally out of control and Air India staff was grossly untrained to handle the situation. Sometimes, that staff would say people would be accommodated on Jet Airways, some passengers would be taken to Coimbatore and Kochi. Anyway, there was no clear communication from a responsible AI staff. In the meantime the Air India counter was like a zoo with people swarming for want of information.

The reason for the cancelation was that the flight from Sharjah did not arrive. Obviously, Air India knew that the flight from Sharjah did not take off well in advance. So, why did they not announce the cancelation? This is my second bad experience with Air India in a week. In the previous week, the flight from Mumbai to Kozhikode was delayed by 4 hours.

I have heard a lot about how good the service in Air India is, about the quality of food and all. But in the past few years there has been many news reports about the bad service, how during mid flight the window pane came out and hit a passenger's head, the rude behaviour of AI crew, etc. The flight I boarded from Delhi was a terrible old machine. It made noise as if we were sitting in a boat. The seats and seat covers were brown in colour as if centuries of dust and murk has settled on it. The flight was quite turbulent and the aged machine added to the woe. We were served peanuts and a glass of coke as appetiser. Who serves salted peanuts as appetiser? The old lady sitting next to me asked to fill her half glass of coke and the staff refused to do so. The food was mediocre and tasteless. The staff was very rude and cold. While nearing Colombo my co-passenger wrote a feedback about her experience. It was sealed and submitted. But after some time one of the staff came and started apologising profusely. It means that they opened the feedback form and read it. He stood there for more than five minutes while the flight was going to land and tried to convince her otherwise. This was my first experience with AI.
While on the return flight the flight had a delayed start. We reached Chennai with a little time to catch our connecting flight. During the long transit and security check the old passengers were asked to walk for at least half a kilometer. They did not offer them any assistance at all. After reaching the flight an old lady complained about this to the flight staff. She said I am feeling uncomfortable because I had to walk so long. There was no assistance. Instead of offering an apology the rude staff said if you are feeling uncomfortable then you should not travel on this flight. We can ask you to deboard. I was shocked by this arrogance and audacity of that guy. They should realise that we are paying for their service. They are here to assist us especially the senior citizens. Many times things go wrong but then a sensitive conversation would matter a lot. These people think that they are in govt service so they will be protected and can do anything. So I have decided to avoid AI at any cost. I am not saying that other private flights are better. But at least there is some pretension that we are the customers. Indigo is another such private company whose staff and crew have developed this arrogance. It is slowly creeping in. A major reforms in the behaviour of flight crew and staff is required."

When I asked them to wait for me as I'll hurry and do it, the person said no! After contacting the manager of the Mumbai Airport, Mr Debashish Golder, I get a response saying I was lying about the check in time and I actually checked in at 7:58 p.m., 2 minutes before the gates were to be shut. Also since I'm a student I had to book a flight the same week and was forced to book air india business class as no other flights were available. I was also charged a $400 no show fee and a $ 250 reissue fee. Nobody does that! Air india is a scam, do not buy these tickets; they do not respect people especially women and ill treat and harass the passengers!"

And back
Mad-Del-bom-goi

On every other instance I’ve been indifferent to the service from Air India as there was really no differentiator
But each segment I took, the clear differentiator was service.. maybe it was business class factor, maybe lower number of people sitting in the B class .. I don’t know .. I know we received spectacular assistance and service from the staff

Service- 5
Food- 3.5 (salad on Madrid flight, mind blowing!)
Seats- 4
Cleanliness-4
Lounge-3 (food in lounge was a let down, this was perhaps the Delhi airport small things like give the wifi password when the guest comes to the lounge would reduce the guest effort to go to counter again. Finding the lounge was inconvenient, very inconvenient.. could be mentioned when tickets were being handed over)

We faced a ticket issue at the Madrid airport.. our agent goofed up and while there was a valid ticket, it wasn’t blocked and my friend would have to stand in various queues if the Air India manager at Madrid Baragas airport had not stepped up and worked with her team to support. I should have written her name, a lady from Calcutta she is and been there on a stint in Madrid... she was professional and above all kind. She clearly emphasised the inconvenience we would go thru and we had paid a bomb for convenience. She made it right for us

Madrid to Delhi they gave us a small toiletry pack that was really cool and lovely. Mine fell between the seats and I could not recover it .. poor me but the hostess offered a replacement if I wanted another

The crew uniformly did a great job

Also Air India... Respect! I’ve often been party to the jest we make of some of the air India staff, we’re so awkwardly cliched to expect young good looking guys and girls and I apologise for my poor and little thinking. These are men and women who have chosen a career and air india chose to allow them the career for giving their best years to the flights.. their best years are even now maybe a few gray hair but the service offered by everyone of them, respect and gratitude

Ill only hope the service remains and I’ll be happy to board again"

After all, the carrier is fully owned by the Indian Government, and the employees have the attitude that nobody can fire them, and they will get their salary, ""no matter what.""

I travelled in this route within a month of its introduction and my experience was very good. Excellent service, good food and Impeccable service. But after 7 to 8 months, it was a complete opposite. No proper service and also no response from Air Hostess. Poor cleanliness and food were bad. But the perks about this flight to Stockholm is you get two 23Kg check-in bags and is the cheapest among all."

When I flew to Delhi, I did not have my baggage! How so? After all, I flew on the same plane on the route Mangalore - Mumbai - Delhi! Why did you unload my luggage in another plane ??? Next: during the flight from Mumbai to Delhi, the flight attendant urged me and other passengers to change seats to other places, at the emergency exit. But I specially reserved this place earlier in Moscow! The steward explained his actions, ostensibly, that the family is flying and they need to be in place all together. But, in fact, the reason was different. This family bought tickets with more spacious seats at the emergency exit, for children, but they could not function in emergency conditions, adults do all nessesary things. Therefore, they began to change seats for children. Why did the steward lie about the reasons for the change of seats? Who is to blame for the situation? The company sold tickets to half of the family at the emergency exit, and, half in another place, but did not explain to them who should sit at the emergency exit. This caused an unpleasant process of moving other passengers, who are not to blame for the problem created by the company. My luggage arrived in Delhi with a delay of almost 2 hours, after my arrival. Thank God, my flight to Moscow was at night, but still, the company Air India, delayed flights, made me jittery and cause discomfort, only for one flight!"

Out of all 4 flights every single one of them were delayed with no explanation or apologies!! Making it nearly 24 hours to get to our destination both ways. When we questioned the counter staff they never gave an honest answer. With 3 kids 4 and under it’s hard when you don’t know how long you are stuck there for.

We had booked a children’s menu for our 3 little ones which they didn’t have and said all they had was the regular menu this was too spicy for them so they ended up having to eat a roll for all 4 flights!! When we queried if we could have more they said they didn’t have any extra’s. No extra snacks or anything. Wasn’t too happy with the kids having to live on 2 rolls and a few pieces of soft fruit in nearly 24 hours!

The journey back was the same for them although it was a night flight so they slept the majority of it luckily.

The staff were rude and not very helpful. He planes were dirty, the service was really bad and so was the food. Def wouldn’t fly with them again. When we complained they blamed us for not booking correctly!!! We have flown many times before with no issues yet we were wrong this time!! Never again would we use them.

My question is - how come Air India was ignorant of the existing rules of a country where they are sending 3 flights a week and allot these seats to senior citizens? I view this as an absolutely callous attitude of Air India. Incidentally, our onward journey seats were also 11B and 11C though we travelled without any issue!!

She has traveled 2-3 times before in the same flight but this time she has not eaten anything during her 8 hour journey because the food stinks. It’s very difficult for senior citizens to travel if they can’t eat in such a long journey as sometimes they need to take their medicines as well after food.

The manager of Air India at Chennai did his level best to make the queue move faster. On board, the crew was welcoming and professional. Only thing that could be improved was the quality of the lunch. The dreamliner was a nice experience and it was very quiet inside.The inflight enetrtainment system for our row (32G) was not working."

The only good thing about the 787 is that the seats are lie flat with good legroom and width. Cabin is showing their age. Plastic is cracked and duct taped in many places. Some IFE screens are defective and the airlines does not bother to fix them. Seats, nook and crannies are dirty. Food is meh. Wine selection is okay. I hope the airlines are servicing the engines and other important stuff properly, since I hear that the parent company is going south. The tickets are quite expensive for what is offered."

The staff were very dedicated, the food was delicious and yes, the leg-room space may not be ideal, but it's definitely manageable!! There's a good selection of in-flight entertainment as well...all in all, I had a very comfortable nine hours!!"

As it takes off from New Delhi, it flies over Pakistan and then turns north!! It goes straight up the globe over Kazakhstan, etc and covers Russian territory! It’s thrilling when it crosses north of Sweden and Norway and goes over Iceland to enter the space over Greenland!! If you are having a clear vision from the window, you can not miss the vast region covered mysteriously by ice!! From there the aircraft descends over the North America towards New York!!
I enjoy the continuously tracking map before the seat and confirming the region by looking down from almost 38000 ft.
The journey is amazing!!"

On return, Air India flight was excellent. It was a brand new plane and business class was 100 times better than British Airways (my usual airline). There is loads of leg room and seats are wide. Plane was clean and service was good. Food was another highlight of the flight-it was delicious. I would definitely choose AirIndia over British Airways."
