Attentive and helpful. On the way out they couldn't wait to turn off the lights and take a break even though it was a late morning flight. Found check in staff to be a little on the miserable side too. Did a 3 flight trip. Heathrow to Delhi then on to Pune. Then Mumbai back to London. They were the same at each airport

On checking in the man at the counter told us that my wife and I couldn't sit together as we were one of the last to check in and there were no two seats together left. He lied.
Asked to speak to his superior and when she came over, he spoke to her briefly in Indian, then she lied. Asked to book an exit row, told all taken, they lied. Asked to upgrade to business, told all sold, they lied.
On boarding the plane we arranged a swap ourselves with another passenger so we could sit together.
On a 12 hour flight, the on board staff, do not consider cleaning the toilets part of their job. By the halfway mark, the toilets were an absolute disgrace. By landing time they were absolutely disgusting. Watched a stewardess kick rubbish into a corner, rather than pick it up.
On landing, the flight was also delayed almost two hours, we were left standing in the aisles for 15 minutes before being told to sit back in our seats, no particular reason gone. Apprarently the plane was supposed to be fumigated before passengers boarded in Delhi, not done. It took an hour before we were allowed to disembark.
It took another hour to collect baggage.
We will never fly with Air India again, and warn anyone thinking of using them, especially if you are Caucasian to reconsider."

It seemed as though many other passengers were careless about where they sat in relation to their allocated seats and this resulted in a lot of milling around before take off. Seat allocation for our party of 4 placed us all well apart. A snack box with sandwich and drink was provided which was adequate for such a short flight. Departure and arrival was fairly punctual. The same applies to our return to Hyderabad on Flight AI 951 eleven days later

My parents were travelling from Kolkata on train till Jammu. They are above 70 years and though medically fit, they still need assistance with their luggage and stuffs.

My flight was scheduled from Hyderabad at 4:30 pm and I reached well ahead. I went through all the boarding & security procedures. However, when we reached the boarding gate, we were informed that the flight has been cancelled. I was in total loss of thoughts since I had a train connecting from Delhi at 9pm which I had to catch to meet my parents.

The AI staff at boarding gates were clueless and did not know what to be done. The passengers had to be escorted back to the AI airport check-in counters. They informed that they will be able to accomodate us at 9:30 flight as the next flight at 7:30 was full. I repeatedly requested at all levels to arrange for an earlier flight since I had to meet my parents to support. All they could reason was that they can connect me to Delhi at their convenient flight.

I asked for a compensation since I will have to book a flight now next day till Srinagar and also stay over at Delhi in the night. However, they refused to accommodate any request. I had to shell out extra for no mistake of mine and I had to keep my old parents stranded. Unfortunate that a national airline doesn't bother about their passengers in distress.

I was so mentally stressed, I couldn't vent any further and match their rudeness."

The outbound flight from Madrid to Kathmandu via Delhi went off without any issues and we were allocated the seats as booked. The in flight service was acceptable but nothing fancy and the drink choices from the bar were very limited. This can't be said for the return journey however. When we arrived to check in for the return flight from Delhi to Madrid, we were given boarding passes with completely different seats to the ones reserved, one of us being in row 26 and the other in row 35. I immediately showed the agent the email I had received from Air India confirming my seat numbers but was told that this was merely a request and that the flight had been over-booked and all previous seating allocations had been changed. After a massive argument involving the check in supervisors we were given two seats together next to the emergency exit and the usual seating supplement was waived. Many other families were having the same kind of issues at the check in desks and it was causing havoc and big delays. When we boarded the flight I could immediately see that my seat was very tatty and the seat back would not go upright properly. This meant that the stewardesses kept coming and trying to straighten it during take off and landing and when serving meals. Not only this but I was unable to use my personal tv screen for the duration of the flight as the screen which lifted out from the seat would not lock into place. It was either a case of holding it up for the whole flight or doing without. Not a good experience at all and would probably try to avoid Air India in the future."

We landed at 8:15 at Sharjah airport, almost 7 hours delay. Me and wife were having office on Sunday and who could not be able to make out to reach office on time. In fact we took leave for that day, coz we reached home around 10:30 post immigration. We lost of particular day loss of pay and included with Friday & Saturday holiday also as loss without pay. Air India did not even offer for water to any passenger during whole delay.
I strongly recommend not to approach Air India Express at any cost. Even though you are ready to go through all this pain.
At first, Air India departed around 12:25 from Mumbai airport which was it self 1 hour delayed at departure. After almost 45-50 minutes fly, flight pilot announced that because of less petrol we have to fly back to Mumbai airport. Post announcement almost after 1:10 hrs fly we were back to Mumbai airport around 2:25 IST. We set in flight almost for an hour and many technicians came to check flight and were searching what was exactly error. By that time we all relies that there was some technical error and not related to petrol. Then 3:30 IST they allowed us transfer pass and again we moved to another gate to catch other flight. Some how they could able to manage another flight by 5:55 IST other flight. And finally, flights departed by 7:00 IST and which reached to Sharjah airport around 8:15 (GST 4:00). Really horrible experience we had ever. This was my second bad experience with Air India Express."

This was unfortunately the wrong terminal and we had to get a taxi to International departures as it is not within walking distance. It was the middle of the night and security had big rifles at domestic departures which was quite intimidating. Security is excessive with three different checks-and no lighters are allowed in the luggage or hand luggage. Also keep powerbanks in your hand luggage and not checked luggage. The flight is one hour long and air India is ok. The ride was not too bumpy and touch down ok. We booked the tickets online on My Trip and had no issues. Online check -in opens 48 hours prior to departure. Returning to Mumbai we had to go to Daobolim airport. Be sure to use mosquito repellent as there are mosquitoes inside the terminal building. The airport also has limited food.
