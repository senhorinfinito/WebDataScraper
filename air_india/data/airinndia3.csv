My first time on a Dreamliner and I have to say I was very happy. After a 12.5 hour flight I felt good and ready to go on despite the 5.5 hour time difference. Service onboard was first class, despite the length of the flight the stewards were always available. Food was very good as well and not all Indian - catered for many, full marks. Excellent selection of wine. Well done Air India - we also returned to Melbourne the same way, again excellent."

Firstly flights from Mumbai to Colombo are not operational anymore and we only found that out once we got to the check in counter. There was no communication about the same to us from the airline. We had to rebook our flight from Delhi and we were put in a third star hotel called Kings Hotel in Mumbai for a few hours. as a result of this we lost a one nights stay in colombo that was already pre paid. From Delhi our flight was further delayed whilst in the aircraft for three hours, no water was even served to any of the passengers. It was only when one passenger spoke out that they finally offered us some water a couple of hours later. The staff seem to have zero customer service skills and the aircraft needs urgent refurbishment (seats broken, turn tables loose). I will never fly this airliine ever again due to their sheer unprofessionalism."

It seems the support in German is just as horrible as in Indian . Not a single email or call give any further information about what happened or how we handle this situation. They write on their website they would give you some interim money but till this day no one called actually to do anything for us. I would recommend to pay 50$ next time and to fly with an airline which provides at least decent support if something happens to you or your luggage. I'm upset and angry how an airline could leave you in such a situation. Food and beverages where quite nice on the flights. Seats where pretty old and dirty.

I did notice that a lot of passengers had just thrown rubbish on the floor even though the staff came round collecting rubbish through the flight. Out connection was seamless, just the usually time spent going through immigration.

The flight back was delayed and although we were given food and a drink in the airport if you wanted to buy your own you struggled due to the food hall closing for cleaning. It would have been better to stagger this.

The meals on the way back were awful breakfast was a half cooked omelette potato wedges and pink sausages. The main meal was mutton and very grisly so we only ate the rice. Staff were friendly and helpful.

had my tickets booked to fly from Cochin to Bangalore 8months prior. 2 days before the flying day, I received notification saying the flight I booked is cancelled due to technical issues.

so I called them with my concern hoping to get it rescheduled to another flight on the same day.
first they denied saying they are helpless because another direct flight is fully booked on their economy class and they refuse to upgrade me to business class like any other airline would have done.
so I offered to pay some extra for the business seats since I have already paid for the economy. but they refused and asked me for full payment for an issue that didn't caused from my end.
After some more arguing they found a connection flight route which takes 13hrs( direct flight only takes 1hr 20mins).
Since I have to catch another flight to Canada via frankfurt, I found it not feasible. At this point I have been on the phone with the senior agent for almost 2hrs.

only help they offered until this point is that they will refund me without any cancellation fees and I am responsible to find my own way to get to Bangalore. so I asked for a written cancellation confirmation, stating all their verbal agreement since I do not trust anything they say over the phone. JUST WAIT, THE WORST IS YET TO COME. the so called senior agent put my call on hold to discuss to somebody and came back after 10mins that they don't have authorization to send me a confirmation about the cancellation. before I can say another word, this SENIOR guy just hung up on me.

I called again and talked to a junior agent and I requested to talk to the senior multiple times. bit he refused to talk to me and I have no confirmation that they will even refund me.

this will be my first and last time to deal with air India

free advise travellers: choose any airline but AIR INDIA. this is by far the worst airline you can deal with."

There was no information provided to us about the delays or where the plane was that we were to board. We were stuck in the airport - not allowed to leave - for over SIX hours. There were no customer service agents, or any AI employees for that matter, past security to speak to. We had security agents call the Air India desk multiple times for over half an hour and nobody would come to talk to us. The flight actually disappeared from the status board without any information available and no announcements. Finally security allowed one person from our party to cross back over security to go to the Air India desk since they wouldn't come to us. The plane arrived shortly after, but the agent that our friend spoke to was not helpful or apologetic. The gate information that finally came up on the status board was incorrect, then we were directed to another incorrect gate. The Air India employee that finally appeared was very rude and unhelpful.

There was more delays once we boarded the plane. The food was disgusting (dry white bread sandwhich, but I couldn't tell you what was on it, other than a few whisps of shredded cucumber). The seats were incredibly uncomfortable.

When we finally arrived at our destination and were looking to leave a complaint, the Air India supervisor acted nice, but the only option that he would give us was to leave feedback on their website... The feedback portion of their website was conveniently very slow and would crash if it actually loaded at all."

TV wasnt working and when all the passengers continuously asked for assistance, they retreated into their little cabin and hardly came out.

I had my parents tray stacked on my seat since my mother needed to used the washroom and a male attendant actually told me off for it - stating that all that rubbish wouldn’t fit in his compartment. What? You could be polite while telling me that.

We had ample time between our scheduled landing time (approx. 8pm) and bus departure (11:30pm). Our first flight from Udaipur to Mumbai was late, as normal with this airline. We also learned that our connection from Mumbai was delayed from 6:50 until 8:45, but the flight didn’t even board until 9:15. We were going to make different travel plans from Mumbai but after being reassured continuously by all of the staff that we would make it, we decided to board the flight. We didn’t take off until closer to 10:30 and needless to say, we missed the bus that we had booked and are going to miss her sisters wedding this morning as there is no other transportation. It took us about two hours to speak to a supervisor to try and work something out and he was unwilling to do anything or even to disclose the reason our flight was so late until we told him he is legally obligated. His response was “weather”. It’s beautiful outside and no other airline had any delays.

My flight into India was also with AI and was extremely late and caused me to miss a bus from Delhi to Rishikesh. Extremely unreliable and terrible customer service. No sense of accountability at all and no regard for their customers. If you value your time and travel plans at all, I strongly recommend you look elsewhere, even if the price is more. Their terrible service cost us about $400, and more importantly the opportunity to attend an important family event. Beware!!!!"

Bad: The entertainment system. This is so bad that everyone knows about it, Many un-responsive screens, bad tablets that have delay touch( if it works). Pilot had to announce the reboot of entertainment system. ( twice). Hence they know.

Advise : carry your own tablet and download your own content, do not rely on Air India entertainment. You have USB points available, so why not.

They customer service representatives do not have any idea about what information they are providing. They don't even know if the passengers have to get off the plane or stay inside when there is a layover. We spoke with Aditya and he told us to speak with the flight attendants regarding this. We booked a business class Chicago to Hyderabad and we get this type of customer service after paying thousands of dollars. This guy absolutely has no idea what he was talking about and when we asked him to transfer the call to a supervisor, he simply said supervisor is busy and when we insisted, he put the call on hold and after 20 minutes the call got disconnected. Really? This is how you guys train your employees? I will never book an Air India flight again in my life and I strongly do not recommend anybody else do it either. We haven’t boarded the flight yet and the experience so far has been so pathetic. No wonder why everybody says do not book an Air India flight. I bet if you take out a survey and ask people about their experience with Air India, 9/10 people will recommend you to not to take Air India. The least you can do is to train your customer service representatives properly so that people will, at least, have something good to talk about your airlines.

My dad had to fly to India from UK on the next flight due to his mother passing away. And unfortunately the flight was delayed by 5 hours which is not ideal in a situation like this. Overcoming this problem, my dad arrived early hours in the morning in Amritsar Airport to realise that his baggage has not arrived. So the first thing my dad done was report this to Air India Baggage desk and received the PIR report and mentioned to call back on the number provided for updates and they would hopefully retrieve the lost bag and get it delivered to the desired address in India.

After calling every 2 days to this number which was Air India Baggage desk in Amritsar Airport, they would just say the baggage still have been recovered and to hold on and wait. I asked about the compensation which they should give if the baggage has been lost for more than 48 hours, in which they replied that this cannot be done as I still have my cabin luggage. So my dad had to buy new clothes etc.

It has now been 3 weeks and again I've been ringing to find out what's going on with my dads baggage and if they found out where it is. They stated, they've located the bag and that it never boarded the flight, so they will get it on a flight and deliver it the next day. We waited 2 days and still we have not received the bag. I rang back, and the lady and man on the phone at Amritsar Airport were being really sarcastic and laughing at the way I was speaking as my Punjabi language is not very good, which I don't appreciate after waiting 3 weeks for a lost baggage. They said either come and collect it or we will deliver it, I said deliver the baggage as we have spoke about many times on the phone. And I mentioned I would like to put a claim towards this as its been 3 weeks without a bag and still currently not received the bag. They mentioned I cannot do this as they have found my dads bag. And insisted that if I want to claim go to London and do it, we won't do it here. So no one from Air India wants to take responsibility for a baggage lost for 3 weeks.

Every time I spoke or try get a claim for this 3 week delay of baggage from Air India, I get shoved to the side and get excuses to why they cannot pay out for this. Imagine going on holiday without any baggage, how much loss has my dad had compared to how much Air India made on his flight to India is outrageous!

Never will I fly or let my family fly with Air India, worst ever interaction and experience I've had with an Airline. Treated so poorly and unacceptable for them to be making money of people who are unable to make claims or even make reviews like I am now!

If anyone reads this, I urge you to think 100 times before booking a flight with Air India, you're better off paying bit extra and fly with anyone else besides them. Never have been treated well with Air India!"

We flew Business class and while we were checking in our luggage, we were erroneously charged extra. The Air India ticketing agent in DEL insisted that as per United Airlines policy (because we booked through United Airlines), only 1 check in bag is allowed per person, and we had 3 check-in items. All bags were under the 32 kg limit (as allowed in Business class) per bag, but they would not allow all 3 unless we paid for the 3rd bag. We argued with them for a bit, showed them the email confirmation from United when we booked the flight, but they would not listen. The agent and the manager were talking to other people at the same time! Didn't even show us the courtesy of listening carefully to us. They just insisted that we pay US$255/ INR 17,830 to check the 3rd bag all the way from DEL to LAX (via HKG, & NRT). It was a terrible experience. Since I only had USD, I paid them US$255.

While both of these are true, the inflight entertainment (the IFE system), did not work for any of us both onward and return, thus making the 19 hours in flight a bad overall experience. The touch screens did not react to touch and the remote in the seat was broken (refer to photos). The worst part was that there was no apology of any kind from the Stewardess. Rather the Stewardess silently disappeared and never came back. Any time we reminded we were told that it would be reset and the re-set did not work. The worst part was that we could not switch off the reading light as the remote did not work. Neither could we call the stewardess as the calling monitor did not work either.

For nearly a decade, British Airways have been the only regular airline offering direct return flights from London to Bangalore. When using BA, I used to feel like a second grade citizen with their pathetic service, but as they maintained a relative monopoly on this route I really had no choice.
I was very pleased to see another option with Air India available, so I booked (nearly 10 months in advance) for the family to travel (Dec 20 to Jan 4) return journey spending over £2600 (2 adults 2 children). Flew direct to Bangalore, and via Delhi back to London to maximise time spent in India.
I was glad I paid £50 extra for seats on the return journey, a day before we flew. More details later in the review below:
- Leg-space was better than any airline for economy seats
- Food: 3 out of 4 meals were really good, and the 4th comparable to most European airlines (in terms of flavour/taste and quality for an Asian person)
- Service & Entertainment: Hot and Cold
(a) London to Bangalore - the older cabin-crew lacked customer service skills, and my entertainment system was broken
(b) Bangalore to Delhi - flight delayed by 20 mins, but there were constant updates, and the flight was boarded in an efficient manner. No entertainment on board
(c) Delhi to London - The ground staff in Delhi couldn't get the plane boarded in an orderly manner, and seemed clueless. The younger cabin-crew who were courteous and efficient. BUT, my entertainment system was not working again!
- Point to Note: if you would like your family to sit together, and don't manage to bag the ""free seats"", I would strongly recommend buying seats in advance. There were families with small children who were aghast that they were seated individually from their young children, and had to request passengers to swap. While I empathize with the families, this is now becoming a common practice among most airlines."

The plane had the old, standard recliner seats that did not go back far and were rather uncomfortable. I found it impossible to sleep. The cabin appeared rundown and in desperate need of an update.

The flights were good, especially the 787 dreamliner from COK to DXB, but AI has disappointed us in terms of overall passenger handling and baggage management.

They didnt mention anywhere that i have to do a self transfer at COK and i have reiterated before booking through the call centre and what they told me is that once you handover the baggage at TRV, you will receive it at DXB.

Contrary to this, the check in agent at TRV told me through check in is not possible and i have to collect my baggage at COK and check in again for the next flight. Additionally, i had checked in online for both sectors and selected seats, but they had deleted my COK - DXB check in record from the system at TRV, apparently due to some system related issues. (thats what they told me). As a result i lost my preassigned seats chosen at the check in time and due to this reason, my special meal request was also not served.

I understand that these flights were from two different terminals at COK but that doesn't look like a valid reason because these two terminals are adjacent to each other and i have seen AI providing through check in at DEL though the terminals are 7-8 kms apart.

The check in staff at both TRV and COK doesn't look experienced and they were unable to provide me a valid justification for both these problems. Moreover I experienced a no care attitude from them as if they have no responsibility towards the customer.

Altogether a bit disappointing experience and i suggest to consider these aspects if you are travelling this sector, especially if you are travelling with family and luggage.I am also a bit sad because even after coming with a really good flight schedule how the mismanagement at operations level is creating unhappy customers and eventual loss of business"

Economy",Some flights are delightful experiences. This was the exact opposite.,"I recently flew from Mumbai to London (Heathrow) and courtesy of Air India, this was probably the worst flight of my life so far. The flight was delayed to begin with, as was our previous flight in the opposite direction. Following a near 2 hour delay, we eventually set off in what was categorically the least comfortable flight I’ve ever had the displeasure of enduring.

The seats had little to no cushioning between my back and the structure of the seat and the head rest is placed at an angle that forces you to be hunched over, which caused serious discomfort for the 10 hour flight. At the start of the flight I used my jumper as a pillow to try and combat this, however the temperature of the cabin was then turned down so low that I practically froze to my seat. Hence, I put my jumper back on and covered myself with the provided blanket, although this did very little to battle the excessive cold. I wondered if I had a fever or something similar, until I looked around and saw nearly every other passenger in the same position as me.

I’ve since had to have the problems with my back fixed by an osteopath (yes, it really was that bad) which completely undermines my buying the cheapest flight available to save money (as most of us do when flying long distances around the world).

Whilst some of the staff on board were perfectly friendly, others were less welcoming and we were made to feel quite uncomfortable at times. Sitting as a family of 4 we were asked to move around to accommodate other passengers despite previously booking seats which we had to pay for and eventually settled to find that (as had been the case on our previous flight from London to Mumbai), the in-flight entertainment system did not work; a recurrent theme with Air India I’m told. The crew tried to restart the system, which then caused all of the reading lights in the cabin to turn on in my section of the cabin to turn on (perhaps unrelated) which woke up many of the passengers. For some reason, this was unique to our part of the cabin though and was not rectified which made it even more difficult to sleep on the already uncomfortable flight - striking off both of the key time killers (sleep and films) for the long-haul flight.

We all know airplane food is infamous for poor quality, however luckily in this day and age, there are plenty of airlines that offer a perfectly okay (perhaps even good!) meal whilst airborne [heads up Emirates]. Air India is not one of them. The food was once again unappealing (despite my personal love for Indian cuisine) and refreshments were offered so infrequently that you would have to get up if you wanted anything. For some bizarre reason, Air India also gives out water in 200ml containers, meaning that you get no more than 3 sips of water per bottle, with the crew doing their best to give you as few bottles as possible when you ask - I can only assume to sadistically ensure you leave the plane with a headache as well as a bad back. Not only for the inconvenience, but also from an environmental perspective (plastic waste - little to none of which is recycled I assume), I thought this was a bad practice.

Saying all of this though, it would be unfair not mention how Air India does compete with other airlines. Of course you also get all the added free bonuses of long flights with Air India - crying babies, unclean bathrooms, permanent noise in the cabin, etc - though, to be fair, some of these factors are out of their control. This being said, all of these factors contributed to my arriving on home soil in a sore, frustrated and delirious state.

I don’t consider myself a fussy passenger, nor would I say that I’m particularly precious when it comes to food, sleeping arrangements, service in hospitality, etc; however I do think that Air India seriously missed the mark on this one. Maybe this was an isolated occasion, and to the pilots (who got us there in one piece) and those staff who did try to make all their passengers more comfortable throughout the flight I apologise for such a scalding review, but equally I would say that my account of my experience is fair and honest.

India is a beautiful country with a hugely diverse culture and I can not recommend it enough as a destination for travels or simply a break when your normal routine begins to feel mundane. There’s so much to do, see, taste, discuss, learn, etc and I would highly recommend going there. But if you do choose to go, please make absolutely sure that you do not fly with Air India."

Customer service non existent. Not sure how such rude people are qualified to serve as air hostess in international flights. From the time we boarded, none of the air hostess greeted us not did they help when we had difficulties finding overhead storage. Their response is ""do it yourself"".

Beverage is served only once in a >14 he flight and tea n coffee only with meals. No snacks served. If we wanted to get water or juice etc in between by going towards the pantry, one air hostess treated us as intruder n made the passengers feel guilty even for asking.

The call button is useless because no one comes even after calling 10 times at least. What about the old ppl or ppl on wheel chairs. What will they do if they something as simple as water.

And the plane itself is horrible. Screen n headphone jacks don't work in some of the seats. I was sitting at one unfortunately. Vomit in restroom. Toilet paper missing. The aircrew stored trash in one restroom and it was unusable.

My suitcase chain was cut open from the TSA lock. And the lock is missing. Items damaged and a phone box torn open. The phone was not in the box luckily. M sure it's an attempted theft. The ground staff as usual rude and too busy just strolling that we couldn't even ask her for any info. She lectured us about TSA. I know more than her about TSA policy than her. My broken lock bag was called a minor damage. The email id provided turned out to be fake.

We travelled on flight AI 317 at1305 but forgot to get the name of the hostess to actually mention her by name. I hope the company recognises her best efforts.

The aero bridge was not used and it took ground staff about 20 minutes to bring and to connect the mobile steps to aircraft to commence deplaning. There were about 15 staff staff on the ground but the equipment was not prepositioned. The bus took us to terminal but the driver only opens one door for deplaning when we have two sets. The Airport at Mumbai is very good design. Then the Saga of arrival of bags. Our business class bags took longer to arrive then the economy class bags. Then the Quarantine wanted to scan all our bags even when we had only a domestic sector from Delhi to Mumbai.

I’ve been traveling frequently to and fro to nepal never been experienced such an horrible ground staff service at Delhi international airport. Worst people ever. Kathmandu to Delhi air India flight got delayed so I missed my connecting flight from Delhi to Colombo which was Sri Lankan airlines, I had both the boarding passes with me. But both airline didn’t take responsibility and after 40 hours I booked myself a new ticket from Delhi to Colombo. I was not provided accommodation or food just was there near the transfer counter for more than 36 hours. While I was there I saw other passengers too having the same problems. Irresponsible, worst ground staff at Delhi airport never compromise with them if not they climb on your shoulders and eat ur your head"

Seats are quite comfortable and converted to full bed with several lean back options. They provided comfortable blankets and pillows to relax. This aspect of Air India was very good however the service and communication with the flight attendants were below average. The food served was extremely mediocre and they failed to warm up bread and there was no butter or salt/pepper even after we asked. The salad had no dressing and they did not have any available when we enquired about it.
The entertainment system worked but was quite old and desperately could use updates. Movie and show choices were sub par.....overall average+"

We were aware of the troubles in Assam as a consequence of an Indian Government Bill on citizenship so we booked a flight out the same day as we understood that the airport was being blockaded. The night before travel we booked a flight on Air India to travel out to Kolkata. The Druk Air flight (Royal Bhutan Airlines) was running late but this only lessened our layover. Then, for reasons unknown, Air India moved our original flight from a 2pm time slot to 12.20pm. At that point I contacted Air India to advise that we could not make that accept that time change and advised we would need ot change from AI7930 to AI775. So, we were covered - or so we thought. Later Air India changed the flight back to 2pm. The flight into Guwahati was later than expected but we thought we were covered. As AI775 was scheduled for 6.45. The only snag was Air India reservations has done nothing.
I explained to the Duty Manger the situation who did next to nothing other than offer the chance to repurchase seven seats on AI775 for over INR110,000.
The Druk Air representatives did their best to convince Air India that they should try to help but to no avail.
There is little wonder that Air India is struggling to make a profit and win customer appeal. The new carriers are taking market share - and now it is easy to see why.
Given the circumstances, I though using a more expensive full-service carrier would have flexibility and certainty to a challenging situation. It only added bureaucracy and unhelpfulness."

This trip was just under 20 hours bed to bed.

Arrival and departure times are friendly with a mid morning departure and an early evening arrival.

We had reservations based on other reviews but we wanted direct. We took advantage of their upgrade program and 24 hours before departure got a confirmed business class seat at roughly 50% of tack pricing.

1. There is no one to assist or direct you while you randomly try to understand which queue you should join.

3. The employees would randomly leave their open counters for hours, until some customer asks for explanation and yet they do not respond.
4. I had a flight originally scheduled to fly at 9:50 am I was in bag drop line from 7:40 am. Had only 12 people in front of me , yet I received my boarding pass at 9:15 am.
5. There were a lot of people who were missing their flights due to the terrible management of the ground staff.
6. When finally I reach my gate, my flight is now delayed and boarding started at 10:15, finally take off at 10:50 am
7. The flight is so dirty that you might wanna puke. There are stains and dirt on the seat covers.
The window pane appears to be a decade old and lastly when I was too tired to look anywhere else I saw peanuts spilled at the corner of my leg area.
This was the last nail in the coffin. To buy a ticket of 5000 INR to have this service is beyond unacceptable.

I was a bit naive as I read others reviews about the flight always being delayed and how disorganized this airline is, but I thought how bad can it be. Well, it is bad especially if you someone who used to deal with airlines who operate on time or at least within reasonal amount of delays. With Air India, delays are consistent. So, I am definitely avoiding Air India to safe myself from the frustration. Also, most airlines delays happen because of the weather conditions, but this airline always late despite the weather."

In the few seats where this was working the movies were not up to date. Crew seemed to be fed up of the airline too and could not do much. The aircraft seemed old and worn out with broken armrest and some remotes were not working. Flights from India had good food with curd and pickle."

They introduced the Boeing 787 Dreamliners for their direct flights from Delhi to Paris, London, Frankfurt, etc., which should have been good news but the poor maintenance of the aircraft dampens the overall experience. The price of a return ticket was competitive, but the rustiness of the aircraft was quite evident. From my seat, I was able to see that quite a few of the in-flight entertainment systems weren't working. They were mostly frozen or weren't taking inputs from the remote. The middle-aged French couple seated on the two seats next to me almost looked embarrassed when they struggled to push the seats back to get a more comfortable position. On top of that, the lady's remote broke and the touchscreen's options were also not accepting any commands. Thankfully the food was better than I thought along with the liquor options. Also, the crew was good and the flights are generally on time. So, if they want to survive perhaps they should get the planes serviced and start acting on the consumer feedback.
It could be a one-off experience, so I'd still recommend it as it saves time and well, it's Indian."

However, we didn't enjoy the flights due to various reasons: First, the seats were to be convertible into full beds, which did not happen. It was like a semi-recline and so we couldn't sleep well. Then the USB ports were damaged and so I couldn't charge my cell phone. The entertainment system was very slow and didn't work in some seats. The toilets too were ordinary and didn't have many normal, needed usables like paper cups. There was no Wi-Fi.
I have traveled in business class in other airlines like Emirates where the atmosphere and the experience has been much better, with working free Wi-Fi even in economy class.
We wanted to patronize our national airline but unfortunately our experience was poor. The saving grace was the good service by the service crew."

Before the journey began I was informed that the flight would now take off from Mumbai at 9:10 pm, so a 40 minute delay was already in the works. At the airport the flight people started boarding the passengers at about 9 pm so I was guessing that maybe there won't be too much of a delay beyond what had already been announced. Oh how wrong I was...
Everything that could go wrong probably went wrong..the flight attendants and other staff for some reason kept asking some passengers to shift some cabin baggage to the cargo section..these formalities kept taking time..when a lady asked for help in placing her bag in the overhead compartment,a flight attendant told her it's not my job, what can I do😯
Another passenger asked when the flight would leave, another attendant replied that go and ask the captain😠 It was extremely unexpected to find cabin crew behaving in such a rude and unprofessional manner..they kept announcing 10 minute delay for commercial reasons..i dont know what that means..in any case the delay extended to more than an hour..from 9 am to 11 am we kept sitting in the flight..the flight people didn't even have the courtesy to offer refreshments or even water to the already tired and harrassed passengers..it was a bad experience for me and I will think more than twice before I voluntarily book an air india flight ticket"

We had a 5-6 hours journey to Delhi and after a 5 hours stopover further to Bangkok.
Same route just opposite on our way home again.
I really liked many things about this airline and their service onboard👍
The food was very ok and free drinks as many as We liked👍Just like onboard any other langdistances flight.
We were served some sort of “Butter chicken” and some lovely kind of naan.
the service and kindness of the stewards and the stewardesses was fine and no complains.
Only downsides was the lack of clean toilets everytime our flights were close to landing.
It was same experiences on all 4 flight we joined this summer.
And one more Big issue: the Security check in Delhi airport:-(((((((
Whorse experience ever in my life, but had nothing to do with Air India.
Delhi airport Security check was a Living nightmare.
Men and women where separates?
One at a time we where led behind a curtain to wait for a lady to touch me literally all over my body and looked at me with her scary eyes like I was the whorse dangerous criminal in the entire World.
She took my only lighter and told me that she had to open all our bags to check for drugs😱
She did the same procedure on my 14 year old daughter which was a scary experience for her as well as it was for my 13 year old son.
Before our Arrival in India, we had massive of checks in Denmark.
I don’t understand why we had to go through all theese procedures so many times when we obviously and impossibly couldn’t have had any contact with the outside World behind the airportwalls
neighter in Denmark nor in India???
At our final arrival in Bangkok Security procedure was excatly the same as always in Thailand.
Photos were taken, stamps were put in our passports and visas were issued quite quick like I had tried many times before."

We pushed back from the stand at 19.25 and were actually airborne at 19.40, which was 50 minutes later than scheduled.

During an announcement by the Cabin Crew, there was an apology for the delay but no reason given. We were also informed that the flying time would be 1 hour and 15 minutes.

The aircraft was an Airbus A321, everything about it appeared a bit dated and jaded including the seating. On the plus side the legroom was generous and we were able to stretch our legs out.

About 15 minutes into the flight we were served with a snack box and a small bottle of water. The box contained a carton of juice and a finger sized sandwich with coleslaw filling. Thankfully sachet of tomato sauce was provided, gave the sandwich some flavour.

So despite leaving Goa 50 minutes late, we landed in Mumbai at 20.35, which was only 5 minutes later than scheduled and it was only a 55 minute flight and not 75 as announced. Airline scheduling at it's best."

3. No passenger control once on the flight. There were no clear safety rules enforced consistently. Passengers out and out yelling at each other at times and the crew just stood by and watched.

The speed was such that single check-in was taking more than 15 minutes. I was traveling with my 8 year old daughter, who had fever and no energy to stand for so long in the waiting queue. After about 40 minutes of standing in queue, I approached the staff doing check-in, requesting to accommodate my check-in request on priority, since there was no priority line for travelers with situation like us. To my amazement, the staff didn't utter a word, and ignored me totally. When I requested twice, she again gave a look, as if she didn't know what to do or say. Similar situation was faced by us, after arriving at Delhi international airport, where the queue towards baggage collection was almost a kilometer long and moving at snail pace, adding to the agony of tired and sick travelers. During flight also, the sound system wasn't working on my screen and therefore, I tried calling air hostess twice to address the issue but in vain. She kept giving lame excuses. Overall pathetic travel experience with air India, most of it coz of mismanagement and callous approach of staff."

Greetings! I heard so many bad comments about Air India but this time I configured it by myself. There is no doubt that government is going to privatize them because the staff is truly so unfriendly and so unprofessional. I had an international flight from Delhi to Sri Lanka on 30 November early morning. Unfortunately I took Air India from Dehradun to Delhi because it was dropping me directly at International terminal. Flight time was 8:30PM but on the screen it showed 1 hour delay which was ok but not convenient because my next flight was at 12:30 AM so anyhow I was suppose to be at counter at least one hour before. Air India announced that they are 2 hours delayed and they flew at 10:20 from Dehradun and we landed at 11:20 at Delhi. I ran away after picking my luggage from the belt but could not reach on time and finally I was a looser.
The horrible things was when I approached Air India counter they started to pass me to each other's counters. First person said you go to third counter, third one sent on 5th. I was just tired of their freaking lazy system. They are so careless and don't care about people who are suffering from their silly working. I seen so many people to fight with them because they are just careless. I wrote email to their customer service, nicely I got an automatic reply that very soon we will contact to you but still nothing happened.
I highly recommend people not to fly with them. If someone does please do it at your own risk. Thank you."

I recently travelled to Delhi with Air India, I thought it would be a good experience as it is their national airline. After booking my flight, I decided to pay nearly £200 for extra leg room seats (3 people). What a mistake that was! The check in staff refused to allocate our seats to us, they were rude and aggressive and accused me of forging the documents I had as proof of seats. I was left with no choice but to accept their seats otherwise we would have missed our flight . Air India is a budget airline and the food, entertainment and service reflect this. The male stewards are rude and unhelpful but the lady hostesses are friendly and allowed another western disabled lady who had also prepaid for her seat but didn’t get it, to sit in an extra leg room seat. On returning home, I contacted Air India and was told I could only ask for a refund if I email their e-commerce address but you’ve guessed it, I have sent several messages but of course they don’t respond! I strongly recommend if you are a westerner do not use Air India as they take your money and give your seat to an Indian traveller at you expense."

I fly business class a lot and I use many different airlines because timing and duration are more important to me than FF points. Air India seems to be stuck in time. Their planes have a really old fit-out. The food on the plane is bland and unimpressive. The staff think they are teenagers working at KFC, hiding behind a curtain and playing with their phone. They are nice and smiley when you talk to them, and probably are just a shamed to be working in one of the worst major airlines in the world.

The lady at the business check in counter was so over it, thumping on her keyboard, making mistake after mistake with my details, and then she suddenly got up said ""Goodbye sir"" and started walking away. I looked at her, shocked. She turn back and said ""Did I give you your boarding pass?"". ""No, you didnt"". She huffed and came back into her chair to print it. Pfff, if not for the comedy factor I would lose it.

The business lounge in Delhi is spacious, but again, old looking; and the food, again, is disgusting (I love Indian food, but the food in the lounge is not that). I find myself eating at the foodcourt at the airport and coming into the lounge only to work using the wifi. But wait, air India thinks Wifi is not a must have for the business traveller. I've spent 5 hours in the lounge using my roaming mobile hot spot because the wifi at the lounge was faulty and Air India put zero effort to fix it. Come on. It's almost 2020, when you have a lounge full of customers who paid $4K+ for their business tickets you make sure they can do their business and fix the wifi. But instead, the staff in the lounge were angry with me for asking about fixing the Wifi ""Sir, Air India will not fix the wifi. We have asked for it, but they will not fix it!"". (This was said to me by an Air India lounge staff).

So again, if your time is precious and Air India has a much shorter flight times or better schedule, then appreciate your life and loved ones and get home early. But if you have other flight options, use those and avoid this backward airline until they pick up their game."

This plane had to be the most uncomfortable plane I have been on. Leg room was OK, but the seats were rickety, my friend's food tray broke on the way home, the entertainment system didn't operate either way for some of us, part time for the rest (16 in our group). The movie selections were marginal (& stopped, needing to be rebooted) and music was worse on any flight ever. My reading light didn't work either direction -- for a 14 hr flight!!! Seemed the cabin crew was less than usual on an international flight & we weren't checked on much. Some in our group flew business class home & had a screaming kid for 14 hours with no parent intervention. We were better off in economy. We also flew Air India Kolkata to New Delhi on a much nicer plane for the 2 hr flight. Go figure!"

The kids ripped apart the headset and blanket and I had to ask them thrice in order to get one blanket.

There, you are shunted to another counter where the person handling the large amount of people needing to pay for excess baggage was overwhelmed and could not work quickly enough. This caused some people in line to become quite agitated. Could have been pre-purchased like most other sensible airlines really. The flight itself was uneventful."

But the apathy and inefficient service in Delhi was disgraceful and nerve wracking - people missed their flights, or flights were delayed because it took 4 hours to get to the gate!
The exaggerated time to get to the gate was not because of security checks or passport control, but because of the poor service of the airline.
It is the country's govt. airline, the largest check-in area in the airport - but less than half the desks were manned.
When I complained about waiting over two hours just to get to the check-in counter, one of the workers, just sitting doing nothing said ""It's a government run airline"". That was their customer service.

Eventually told that a different aircraft was in service but no one was very bothered or interested.
Boarded the aircraft and all was well for a while. Have to say the entertainment was abysmal with old old movies & t.v.shows. One drinks service only and meals that weren't really all that great. All crew disappeared for a good few hrs leaving water,juice and cake in the galley so you had to help yourself. Crew only reappeared about 90 mins before landing.
Return journey not any better with window blinds all closed despite it being a day flight and an announcement made to the effect that people should not not recline their seats as it bothered those behind !! People given seats with extra leg room despite having not paid for them (we had paid!!)only because they got annoyed with the crew when they were around. Wouldn't fly long haul with AI again ever."

The business lounge used in Birmingham is not very good (compared with Emirates which is first rate).
Noticed reduction of frills enjoyed by business passengers this time,it does not bode well particularity if the fares are going up all the time!

I wanted to change the date of travel and was told that after completing one leg of journey,one change is free,not true! They wanted INR 6000
If the flight is changed from Amritsar and you wish to fly back from Delhi (no change in distance) then it is classed sector change and AI wanted INR 21000,does not make any since when other airlines happily allow travel from one or other airport eg Emirates let you choose any Indian Airport !

The choice of music and films is phenomenal,flat beds are wearing out and need re furbishing,dream-liner is not as comfortable as in the past. Meal was good but no breakfast prior to arrival!!

You are a fool now. if you try to argue, they will treat you a fool. If you ask for a refund, they will say- ""had you paid money to me? what refund? Go and ask refund to that telephone guy, who you had paid money"".
If you talk to their feudal supervisors like ""I had booked seat 17x and i has been alotted to someone else. Why ? Help me get my pre-paid , prebooked sear back"" That guy will act like a feudal lord and try to intimidate you. First try to insult you with statements ""Front seat? do you know what you are talking? Front is Business and you are economy. Now just go to your economy seat.Dont waste my time""
When you counter "" Its not about front or back, its about seat 17x""
then Feudal lord will again insult you"" Do you even know, its paid seat. what you are talking about? go back""
you counter again"" Thats what I said wih my opening statement. stressing ""Pre-paid"" and ""Pre-assigned"" seat has been allotted to someone else. Help me get my seat back""
Feudal lord will roar again ""Why should U trust you.""
You get some more courage to talk and pull out the printout ""Sir, here is the evidence of seat allotment and payment"".
And The Feudal Lord their floor supervisor will just run away !! Other staff will ask you, you wanna fly or miss the flight. They will scold you, get inside if you want to go.

Hats off the shrewd and screwed hospitality of Maharaja !! Full of himuliatio, intimidation and insults to the passengers who paid $1250 (higher than other airlines just for sake of Desh Prem)

2. Air hostess/ Stewards- Folks, remember, sun never rises from west, so do the AI hostesses and attendants. You press the 'call attendant' button and they will never ever come to your seat asking what happned.You die their for something, any emergency happns for any elderly person, take my words AI hostess/ steward wont come to your seat

3.Food- Used to be good till 2018. Now pathetic would be understatement. Quality has degraded substantially and they reduced one meal too recently to save on costs, even though they charge you 1250$. Similar haul flighs serve you 3 meals, AI served just 2 even when flight took 4 more hours.Literally, really and physically starved

Snacks (chips/ Soda/ Water/ Drinks) - heavily rationed with a strong eye. How other airliners do on such long haul flights
Emirates- they place plenti of such stuff like Cucakes, chips, peanuts, coke/ soda/ water , sandwiches at central location and you are free to take. Qatar staff is always there to come to your seat and serve.

But AI- guys no snacks, No water. Remember point #2, they wont come to your seat. When you trace these feaudal lords to their Den, the response you can expect is
a. Dont you see, its our break and we are eating snacks. come after 30 minutes. You beg, i am very thirsty, just water please. Nad they retort, our break time. come later.
b, You go later and ask for water again, you get a cup of water. You ask again, and listen- 'dude, how much water you need' already gave you two cups.
c. Drinks- yeah, once they serve, then forget.

Food serving attitude- Cant be explained in words. Fly once to see, how these feudal lords serve food in AI 101/102/103/104 flights. Remember, you are a begger and starving for almost 6 hours now. and someone with a big heart suddenly pulls in with a trolly and ray of hope. These lords will start trowing food packets / trays. Get up on your seat and hold it.
Sssssh, are you sleeping ? Get ready to be scolded. ""Mr/ miss get up. Food is here. How many times, I need to say you""

4. Entertainment- Do you need more after enjoying 1,2 and 3 above? Still craving for entertainment, try to turn on the TV on seat. Much to your pleasure, more than 60% of these screens wont function. Even the one workings would be sluggish to respond with a poor selection of movies and soaps.

5. Restrooms and toilets- On this 16 hour flight, avoid using them 10 hours. Most of them would be damn dirty by now and clogged as well. God Knows how Maharaja manages !

6. Checkin ( Again)- Everywhere they print ""Come ATLEAST 3 HOURS PRIOR to departure time. And try it yourself,if you came, you are a BIG FOOL. For 1:30 AM flight AI doesnt open the checkin counter before 10:30 PM. If you try to show them the print stating ""Come ATLEAST 3 HOURS PRIOR...."", They will try to convince you to improve upon your language skills and get some basic english in place. They interpret is as come after 3 hours is left to depart the flight. This situation prevails at DEL/BOM/ JFK/EWR and IAD. If you came prior to 3 hours before departure, hold your luggage and enjoy your time.
For them, its fun when they have a big long queue already in place to open the checkin. Planning, peace, comfort, convenience is not in Maharaja and AI dictionary.
Once they see all 380 passengers are there, all in queue, the feudal lords will OPEN 2 CHECKIN counter and let your feel the heat of their power and might. They painful journey started with waiting un-necessarily for counter to open and now such a long queue with 2 counters only. AI ensures that you stand in this queue / security till 1:30 am till final boarding call in your name is made.
Even this was not enough, you will notice some travellers have staff friends. For many minutes the queue will not move for such reason. The staffs will oblige their friends and family by taking their passport/ ticket to counter from backend and generate boarding passes.

well,very long story and much more horror story can be shared. Tired of writing this and bored as well,

Stopping here. Bye Bye AI."

This was also my first international flight where there was no in-flight duty free (or for that matter any) shopping option.

The only plus I can think of is that this was a 787 Dreamliner so it was a fairly stable flight given the extreme turbulence on this sector, and we had ample leg room, easily the best in economy class compared to any other airline (I've flown all the major ones)."

The refreshment served comprised of a vegetable sandwich, a tetra pack of Mango Juice (forgot the brand name), plus a glass of water. The flight landed at the international terminal, as always done by Air India at Ahmedabad.

Until deboarding and immigration, all was well. It was during the baggage claim that the unexpected happened.

Air India said that since ours was a connection flight from Colombo and the flight from Colombo had been delayed, the baggage ""could not be loaded"". The check in baggage was at Mumbai only. A customs form had to be filled, baggage tags had to be attached and the bags reached my home only the next day evening. The process took nearly half an hour and was a strain on our mental energy and physical energy as well, after arriving all the way from Colombo via Mumbai.

Slept inflight so couldn't comment on that much, other than the fact that the crew was well groomed and trained, bearing a smile. The aircraft, an A321 Airbus Industirie, was a bit dated.

Being the domestic leg of my international journey to Colombo from Ahmedabad (AI 18), I decided to reach International Terminal of Ahmedabad Airport at 4:20 am (flight departure time at 7:10 am), nearly 3 hrs before departure.

The staff of Air India had the worst ever attitude. They said that they'll begin the baggage screening (mandatory before checkin) only at 5 am. On asking why the website stated that passengers should arrive 3 hrs before departure, they said they had no answer but forced us to wait for the next 1 hr outside the terminal. Very appaling.

Nextly, I had done web check in with the hope that my time at the check in counter would be saved. But Air India surprisingly said that the Ahmedabad airport does not have """"sufficient infrastructure"""" for having a separate bag drop counter. I mean, you're operating this flight from the commercial capital of Gujarat.

The ironic fact is that Ahmedabad was one of the first destinations of Tata Airlines which was the predecessor of Air India and yet, Air India complains of insufficient infrastructure.

The flight was delayed but I don't blame the airline for that - there was a medical emergency on the incoming flight. The boarding was fortunately quick. Refreshment (sandwich) was served before boarding due to 2 hr flight delay.

Inflight experience saved the day. The food was excellent. The crew was smiling and helpful. Thank you so much.

1. Most video units in economy are broken.
2. Remote control was broken - this means you cannot turn on/off lights, cannot call for help from steward/stewardess. My kid couldn't watch TV. They had a central control to turn off all lights which randomly went off. And because most overhead seat specific lights were broken - she couldn't read either.
3. They don't have toilet seat covers!
4. They started to run out of toilet paper
5. Soap dispensers inside toilets were broken.
6. Food from SFO to Delhi was tolerable. Food from Delhi to SFO was downright nasty. When I went up and asked about all the broken things - the answer I got from stewards/stewardess was new management- nothing they can do.

Lastly, the flight back from Delhi to SFO - the steward and stewardess were so de-sensitized to all the request from passengers - they didn't even try to help or problem solve. They seemed like they didn't want to be bothered with asks to help.

We were not sure about this so during the flight, which finally departed with a 2-hour delay, we asked to two more stewards about our transit flight and they again said that we did not had to worry because the flight will wait for us. All this was just a lie from all those people. We arrived at the airport with a delay of more than 2 hours, and they told us that the transit flight left without us… We thus contacted the staff of Air India to ask them to give us a new flight to Colombo and they said that they can’t do anything for us since our next flight was with another company... We have spent 5 hours (5! with just a 25cl bottle of water for free...) in their office to try to solve the problem, it was totally impossible. They told us that we had to pay another ticket (200€ each since last minute) to leave Delhi, and that perhaps, but it is not sure, we will be reimbursed by the company.

It would've made such a difference if she was engaging, apologetic and being helpful but instead she was annoyed and not helping us to stay calm and giving solutions- she wasn't doing her job well. Her name was Bharti Dejani and when I asked for her manager Foss Alwin Mascol- he said even if I book a flight with another airline I wouldn't be guaranteed a seat, it made no sense. The customer service is so poor and incompetent.

They eventually pressured us to GO BACK TO DELHI. Wait for 5 hours for the flight from there to Trivandrum. I've had no sleep. They didn't upgrade our flights or make it more comfortable for us even though it is THEIR fault. I don't even know for sure if all my luggage will be in Kerala. We have spent the day running around the airport and it has been so stressful.

I know one thing for sure, I'll never fly with these airlines ever again. First and last time with Air India"

I waited and was the last one to come out of the plane after 45 minutes. The passengers with connected flights were taken via wheelchair. Second round took couples. And after an hours she was the only one sitting at the gate, waiting to see if comeone would help - no one came - I was told by one of the workers to walk over to the counter - I had to take my personal item and carrybag - reaching the counter, and then from there to the baggage claim - sitting after every two minutes - in tears, and pain. Had they said it initially - I would have seeked helped with the co-passengers atleast - as they were nice - but here I waited till NO ONE was left - this is so pathetic and torturous. Airlines / wheelchair companies should be sued for this purpose for bullying and not doing the jobs they are paid for."

But the agent keep saying no it cant be done without penalty. Every time he asked me to wait for 5 mins but what she actually taken is 20 mins. Finally they accepted the timing difference but still asking me to pay the cancellation fee because there is no option in their system to change. How can they expect me to pay 12,000 just for not having option in their system. Then they asked me contact the New York AI office for talking about this stuff since this booking was made at USA. But nobody from AI office in NY has responded to my calls. I really don't know how could they be so irresponsible when doing business with international passengers. Yes I am indian and i love my country but if the airline has no single good things then i have nothing to say. I strongly suggest people to wait one more day to book tickets at different airline if they ever have a situation of having flight availability only in AI.

On reaching home we found that in one of the suitcases, some electronics had been stolen clearly at IGI Airport by someone with clearance to open secure locks. We were then trapped in Patna floods for several days. We were concerned that someone with security clearance in secure area of airport was committing criminal acts, likely under CCTV. On reaching back Delhi 7 days went to the airport police station, they refused to take the report. I tried to report to Air India - no avail. I reported to Civil Aviation Ministry and Minister, Mr. Puri. I finally received a response to create an Air Sewa (!) Grievance, which I did, and received a response that I will get a follow-up in 2 weeks - I didn't. This is now 4 weeks.

When I told my friends in Delhi, they told me of similar incidents related to the same Air India flight from Terminal 3 at IGI Airport, and that police refuses to suppress these reports.

I was told that their flight never departs at right time, so was the case with me also but they informed well in advance.

The staff on the way out were pleasant, helpful and did a good job unlike the return journey. Most of the crew on the way back were off hand, surly, unhelpful and spent most of the time in the galley having a good time chatting and laughing totally ignoring their passengers leaving all the basic work to 2 of their colleagues who were run off their feet. The return flight had been delayed due to the cyclone in Goa and waited for 84 passengers for about 1 hour 30mins but somehow, on arrival at Heathrow, little help was given to the delayed passengers who had missed their connecting flights. We witnessed 2 stewards speaking to a couple of passengers and were both rude and just short of offensive. The seats did not seem to have any 'stuffing' on the back and we felt as if we were sitting on cardboard. The food was particularly grim on the return flight and all in all, a pretty ghastly time was had by all. I now know why they are cheap.

As I have explained to your customer service I purchased a flight with you from New Delhi to Jaipur on 4th November for two people. I paid for this flight and then received notification or an error without showing the booking reference and was asked to contact customer service. On contacting them I was informed that as I didn’t receive an email confirming the flight which would have the booking reference they could not help me.
I have spoken to my bank and the money is pending transaction. I now am £112.92 short in my account as this payment is committed to Air India with no flights. Please cancel this payment as this is thief.

I will be posting this on as many websites as I can regularly until my money is returned as a warning to others not to fly with Air India. I will also be bringing it to the attention of the newspapers and India Tourist board along with the Trip Adviser etc.

I was really excited about traveling with Air India, but that excitement quickly turned when I entered the plane. It was completely worn out. The hideous carpet, the seats, the entertainment system - everything was just outdated and worn out. This is just the plane, the service was the real disappointment. My co-passenger had a child, and asked for a bottle of water for formula. She asked 3 times, but never received any. She was visibly annoyed, so I chose to help her out, and walk directly towards the air hostess stances. I politely asked for a bottle of water and the air hostess just looked arrogantly at me, and pointed towards the cupboard ""take it yourself"". I was in shock of the lack of service and ethics.

On my way back home from Delhi, the service was a bit better but as mentioned, their planes are worn out. My seat was collapsed as I could feel the metal plates underneath the seat. I requested to be re-seated, which they did after take off. After this, the plane got extremely cold. They had turned on the AC on high, and everyone on board were getting really cold and began putting on more clothes. I put on my wintercoat, which I had brought with me from Denmark, as it was cold before I departed from Denmark. I got really annoyed, and asked them why they had the AC on such a cold level. To this the air hostess replied ""its not in my control, but I'll look into it"". Indeed it was in their control, because it got better 10 minutes after.

Lastly, I had survived India for 2 weeks without any physical problems, but right after eating the food on the plane, I got diarrhea. Thank you Air India! Thank you for solidifying that you are completely incapable of doing anything good to represent your nation! Never ever again!"

Over two hours of phoning and four conversations with lengthy holds I was told to book with another airline (there are none) or to rebook on a later flight (there is only one a day).

Finally managed to rebook for the next day a new flight, possibly only because I rang before they got around to refunding me.

Then I was emailed a week later to say the new flight had been cancelled. Again online the flight was shown as still flying but full.

I can only assume we have been bumped of the flight to allow someone who ""more profitable"" on than us who has only paid the advertised price online.

The week I was supposed to take the flight, the flight was late every day. As well, the baggage limit went down from 25kgs on Air India to 15 Kgs to Alliance Air. It did not make any sense as I has to take an International flight after that and that airlines allows 23 Kgs. I understand smaller planes have small capacity but when I looked, there was another Air India flight at that same time which was not visible at the time of booking.
In the end, my family fored me to cancel Air India and book Vistara."

I was traveling from Delhi to Hyderabad with my husband with luggage allowed 25kg per person and cabin luggage allowed 8kg per person.
We had 5 bags, out of which we had to pass 3 bags weighing total 42 kgs in check-in and other 2 bags weighing total 16 kgs in cabin.
One of the bags in the check in weighed 10kgs.
So now coming to the policy, the person at the counter said that the maximum weight allowed per bags for check in is 25kgs and not more than that and for cabin it has to be 8kgs Max per bag.
Though we convinced him that he should adjust for the check in luggage but for the cabin luggage we had to pay extra for 2kgs which was 1000.
There was no such information provided in the ticket. Prior to this we had travelled a week back with no such rule.
Whom to blame here?? Is it the Airlines for not providing this new rule in the ticket??
Though the total weight never exceeded
Furthermore, while having this discussion with that person he was too rude and not ready to listen to anything.
I must say that if you don't know it already then make sure to know this 😂 to avoid bad behavior and paying extra money unintentionally 😅"

The sandwich, with what looks like coleslaw, should be avoided! Juice was okay. Some passengers brought their own food and the aroma permiated the plane... some okay and some nauseating. The plane on the website seemed different in size and the prebooked seats I got were different. The staff made a point of ignoring my request for a change but changed other passengers.

The legroom was not very generous neither was the seat padding, the seat, however, did recline slightly.

In fairness the seating and legroom were adequate for the length of the flight. The most important factor is punctuality, so arriving ahead of schedule deserves a very good rating."

I booked 5 flights - but ended up taking 8 due to their bizarre routing.

To go from Delhi to Varanasi, the plane flew first to Gaya. What I didn't realise was that Gaya is further from Varanasi than Delhi is. In effect, our flight was similar to doing London to Munich via Athens. Not only was it ridiculously further than it should have been, the flight was also very late by the time it arrived.

Two of our other flights also did ridiculous routes, overshooting the destination before coming back again. Two of the five flights had their times changed, one changed back again, and then eventually left even later than the original change. Honestly, you don't know what time you're ever going to get anywhere with these guys.

Food varies between a bit 'meh' and disgusting coleslaw sandwiches. It doesn't matter if you cut the crusts off, a coleslaw sandwich is still a painful disappointment.

On the plus side, the flights were cheap. Even cheaper if you consider the many hundreds of extra miles we got 'for free'."

All this was done in a rush while telling me that if I'll won't hurry I'll miss the flight and promising me that this suitcase will be on my flight.
I was taken back to the boarding which closed doors right after I have come just to find that my seat was given also to a different passenger and I don't have where to sit.
Then came the first good thing with this flight - I demanded to get a sit by the window as planned so I got a sit near an emergency exit and with a lot of place to my legs.

Economy",Delayed and dirty,"Sunday 13th October we were booked on Air India flight AI 661 from Mumbai to Goa. The flight was due to depart at 16.25 arriving in Goa at 17.55, a scheduled flight of one hour and 30 minutes.

At this stage must say Airline certainly built in some buffer time for delays, allowing 90 minutes for a 55 minute flight

The Aircraft turned up at 16.05, which was 20 minutes before we were due depart. We actually boarded at 16.45.

We were informed that our departure was as result of the late arrival of the incoming flight and then waiting for a delayed connecting flight. We actually sat on the tarmac for the best part of 45 minutes.

Finally we were Airborne at 17.30 an hour and 5 minutes later than scheduled.

We were informed that the flight would be 55 minutes.

The legroom was good, however the interior of the aircraft was grubby, the seat belts were sticky and the doors to the overhead lockers were dirty. In fact even the yellow life jackets used in safety demonstration heavily soiled.

15 minutes into the flight we were given a snack box which contained a carton of juice and a very small coleslaw sandwich. It was no surprise when opening my tray table to find remains of dried food on the table.

We landed at 18.15, which was 20 minutes late arriving.

Thankfully it was only a short internal flight."

However.......

On both legs of this trip the service was sub par - Stewards were disinterested and seemed put out with basic requests such as water to drink. Toilets were filthy and had no paper most of the time.

To top it off, for Delhi-Syd check in (which was an agonisingly slow process just for bag drop) we were told that there were not two seats together. We protested as we had booked the tickets together but were still just handed boarding passes for separate seats. When we asked to speak with someone else this problem was instantly fixed. Curiously, friends who flew the week before had exactly the same experience.

Having travelled and flown extensively I struggle to think of a more frustrating experience."

On arrival we saw dirty, ripped chairs with the stuffing falling out of them, a leaking fridge with newspapers on the floor to soak up the water, a very poor food choice which was served from a messy food area, the crockery was chipped and in the toilets one toilet was broken,there was a broken flushing panel stuck on with sellotape and the hand dryers were broken and falling off the wall.
I complained three months ago,and then again and again,but was told every time that I needed patience.
Patience has now run out so I am forced to post photos.

Just when we were planning to leave home, we were informed that it was rescheduled yet another time 7.20 pm. Anyway we decided to leave for the airport. Finally, the flight took off at 8+ pm. It was a hopping flight. We were served snacks in the first leg and dinner in the second leg. Food was no good. We reached Mumbai past midnight. Had to spend at least one hour for a taxi.

They refused to reissue us with new flights instead wanting us to pay a full fare for new flights. After 3 hours they finally found our luggage, we booked new flights with a different airline. The staff at air India were unapologetic and didn’t really seem to care about our plight. We were foreigners in their country and our missed flight was the fault of the airline.

I have spent hours on trying to become a member but that is so difficult like if you are a Pakistani trying to get an Indian visa, completely ridiculous and I never managed. This last flight it was an airbus with seats extremely small ( and I have a small stature ) like European budget flights for short distances.

Once your bags were found, they issued a new boarding pass.
Because i was coming from a flight with baggage on the piece system, i had two pieces and was over their 20kg limit. I've travelled this route many times before and never had this level of insolence, unhelpfulness, and outright lying. The women told me that I had 46 kgs (it was only 40 once weighed) and insisted that I would have to pay $400 plus tax for my extra 26 kg. I tried to show them information from the AI website to show that $120 was allowed for an extra bag. This went on for three hours until it was close to time for the flight.
They let a couple of other passengers from my flight through even though their bags had not yet been found. Finally the call came that my bags were found. So I went to pay but one of the staff would have to take my credit card up two floors to process the payment.
So, i gave them cash. The senior woman shouted at me that it was only $300 .... but their seen by everyone (me and her collegues) was the other $100 bill with her finger clutching it to the $20 bill. She glared at me and acted like it was a mistake. Then I asked if i could have a receipt, which created more hassle but eventually one staff was sent to go get one.
Then a call that the bags were only 40kg total. Meanwhile, the second woman was stalling giving me my boarding pass so that I could proceed. Her male colleagues were actually telling her to get it done. Finally, she gave me the new boarding pass (I already had an Air Canada one from the previous flights check-in).

Finally, the staff came with the receipt and the $100 bill that was not needed for just 20 kg extra. But, the senior woman walked up to the security check just ahead of me. Some words were said. The security staff tore apart my hand luggage while she watched. Finally it was done and the nice young man staff escorted me to the gate. I was the last passenger to get on the plane but will not be flying with Air India again.
Then the other passengers whom i had been with at the start said that one of the gate staff told them that the bags being transferred never come into the airport and are just moved from plane to plane.
Is all this 'finding your bags downstairs' just a scam to get money out of foreign passengers? One has to wonder."

I have flown and written about AI earlier also and will continue to write as I do for other airlines/hotels. Unlike other airlines, AI is the only business entity who has never replied/contacted me.
When I wanted to web check-in 24 hours before for our Madurai-Mumbai flight, I was horrified to see separate seats allotted by the 'system'. There was no choice available for a change. For a same PNR, same surname( me and my wife) and for a customer who is 2nd to web check-in, how can the system not allow me a choice of my seat( paid or free)? Worse, how could a system alot 2 separate seats( 17 B and 17E)- both middle seats on 17th row, for a couple travelling together?
At the Madurai airport check-in counter, he refused to change the seat. which airlines in the world denies the change of seats.
There is more to it. When I asked the counter guy to enter my 'frequent flyer no.', he said my name and number of AI don't match. This was a news to me.
Coming to the aircraft, it was same type of aircraft for which I wrote earlier once. There is no place to keep water bottle, or my specs or even the mobile phone. Where does one keep these 'daily use' things? No reading material on all seats( 17, A, B,C)..
Coming to the food, ( I don't wanna talk about the sad faces of the crew), it was 'take it' or 'leave it' kind of approach. I could not understand what I was eating. I had to eat what was served since I boarded at 12 45 PM and it was around 3 PM when they served something.( it was a hopping flight via Chennai).
One feels sad about our National Carrier. We also feel sad about their arrogance. While I wish them good future, I don't have any hopes (that someone will contact me)."

We were served a snack - a vegetable mixture in a flakey pastry case with a sachet of ketchup with a 100ml bottle of water and a carton of mango juice which I liked. Acceptable except the service was soulless focused on getting it out quickly on a short flight. Clearing up consisted of dumping everything into a big plastic bag. Bags arrived on the belt within 15 minutes of landing. A smile would have made the experience so much better.

Knowing our baggage was well over the limit for the majority of Indian domestic carriers, we opted for Air India and their 25kg allowance. We checked, double checked, and checked all the T&Cs to make sure we didn't have it wrong, as my partner works in the airline industry and knows what's up. Anyway, after booking through air India website, for an air India flight, we arrive at the airport to be told its an air alliance flight, and we were overweight on the bagge, which now has a 15kg limit. We're not idiots, we checked this, and both agree that it is a clear deception to get extra money out of people. Had we not been rather irritated and possibly argumentative at that time of morning, we would have had to pay through the nose. Thankfully, the check in staff used a little class and had us move some of our clothing into hand luggage to save the bagge fees. This got us on the flight fine, but it makes me scratch my head as we still took the same amount onto the aircraft... Why couldn't we just leave it in the case?? Rediculous.

Anyway, as I said. Check the terms when booking with air India, and they'll still try and charge you more because air India falls under the air alliance umbrella apparently, which would have been useful to know before we booked the tickets, as the website did not mention this anywhere. See photo for an air India boarding pass too.. If I wasn't aware of the power the check in staff have over whether or not you actually make it to an aircraft, I'd have flipped my lid upon seeing that....."

The boarding process definitely needs work. They did not use microphones that day to announce departure. They just yelled the announcements - so not audible to all I am sure. Next, it was a 2 stage boarding. After the boarding pass was scanned, all passengers had to wait in a staging area to actually board the plane. Then, they boarded business class and economy class passengers together in one big mob. So definitely the boarding process needs work :-). But once on board, it is the best of indian experience. Quiet and efficient cabin crew. Very good food. Good pilots - smooth take off and landing. Good entertainment for Indian passengers like myself. So in-flight experience is just as good or better that British Airways. And it is way cheaper! The 4 stars is because on the boarding experience.

However, when I was onboard AI315, my first Air India experience, I was surprised that I am liking everything that I see, contrary to all that I have read. The legroom is the only thing that I didn't rate excellent but everything is more than excellent with this airline. What I liked most is when I asked for a soda refill, the FA immediately poured another glassful of soda on my cup and gave me a whole can of soda afterwards. Not just one, but two!

AI 610 was late by over three hours, with the result that I missed the Swissair flight. What happened thereafter was gross mismanagement accompanied by deceptive, inconsiderate, and totally unprofessional behavior.

I approached the AI counter in the Mumbai airport at about 1:30 a.m., and after waiting patiently for a while (i.e., till I discovered that the only way I would be heard was to shout above everyone else), managed to speak to the ONLY person at the counter, which was mobbed by about 50 people. I explained that I needed to be rebooked to Zurich, and specifically informed him that I was over 65 years old, had serious medical issues, and would he please attend to this asap. He was the manager on the spot, and appeared to be sympathetic and told me that there were five people (including me) that were to be rebooked to Zurich, and his staff would work on that immediately.

From 1:30 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., I repeatedly inquired (almost every 15 minutes) and he repeatedly told me that his staff was actually working on my very case. Around 5:15 a.m., I told the staff member allegedly working on my rebooking that I was on the verge of collapse, having been on my feet for over 24 hours. At 7 a.m., the other staff member who, I had been told, was working on my rebooking, came with the rebooking for a co-passenger to Zurich, who was put on the 8:30 flight. He told me for the first time that he did not even have my ticket details, and was unaware that I needed to be rebooked! In other words, the AI manager had been giving me the runaround, blatantly lying to me.

I went back to the counter, fought my way to the front, but the night manager who lied to me was gone. He was replaced by another woman (no one has name tags in AI), and I gave her my details (again). She was mobbed with even more people, and finally, I gave up at 8:30 a.m., bought myself a new ticket by Emirates, and extricated myself out of that mess. I did not want to be martyred in Mumbai airport for AI's gross mismanagement and deception.

I certainly don't blame AI for the massive floods in Mumbai that day. But it was grossly mismanaged. You had to mob the counter and scream over everyone else just to register your need or talk to someone. And everyone was referred to the Manager, who was often not there. AI must have a better system for rebooking passengers than convert it into a ""Lord of the Flies"" situation.

What was completely unacceptable - indeed, unconscionable - was that I was lied to and strung along for over seven hours for a task that should have taken seconds or minutes at most. That I was was a senior citizen, seriously ill (both of which the manager on the spot was specifically informed), and didn't collapse at the Airport, but managed to step alive into the Emirates flight was purely fortuitous. With such an experience, would you reasonably expect me to choose Air India again?"

When Austrian airlines was operating that direct flight it was pure bliss. Then they stopped and the only direct flight available now is Air India.
Well at first that was bearable. But the steep decline in quality which is happening over the last one and a half years is really worrysome.
Whilst some of the crew are friendly and helpful, most of the staff is just doing the bare minimum of what is expected from them. No smiles, no helping, barking out orders at the customer and basicially not caring about good hospitality at all.
Obviously the ammenity pouches have been cut. Haven‘t received it on the last three flights.
In most of the flights no menu card is given. Instead a crew member is quickly, quickly telling you what is there to eat. But since they do neither bother to bend down to you, nor speak in an understandable speed and loudness, its somehow a guessing game.
Anyhow AI food was never good and so I spare myself the trouble.
In half of my flights within the last two years the inflight entertainment was not working and crew was not able to fix it. Same experience I have heard from a lot of frequent flyers, so its a long standing and known problem, which noone at AI seems to bother about.
Earphones have a pathetic quality and a lot of times exchange is needed because they are broken.
The choice of movies is pathetic.
The cabin and washrooms are not properly maintained and have a shabbyness to them, which has now reached an unacceptable level.
This goes for the seats as well. Last year:One flight seat was not reclinable and in another flight the backpanel of seat was missing so all the wires and cables were hanging out.
It is obvious that the carrier is cutting costs massivly and that leads me to the question: If the inside is so badly maintained, what about the plane itself? Is that done properly?
From next year onwards I will rather spend the double amount of time for going to my destination and changing flights, than everytime have to go through those nuissances with AI.
Recently I took Turkish. This was an eyeopener. This reminded me of how it should be and how the reality is with AI.
For all domestic flights I have been avoiding AI since long. Thankfully there are enough good choices."

I was carrying my bicycle with me and Air France allowed me to take it along from New Delhi.
######### Before the flight
>> I started contacting Air India almost 10 days before my flight in order to know whether I could carry my bike or not, I did that using their email which was not responded to.
>> I called their customer service number twice, each time it took like 30 minutes to have someone to talk to you. The people on the other side gave me contrasting information. So till this point I had no clue if I could take it with me or not.

######### Day of the Flight
>> Going forward with the information that I had, which was based on the information provided on the website, according to which I would need to apply for the transit of the bike with the cargo operations. In order to do that I had to be at the airport about 3 hours before the departure, I was there 3:30 hours before.
>> I was told to wait till the checkin counters opened after which the price quoted was 1575 per kilogram of the bike, at 15 kg, the total of Rs 23625 was quoted, which is around 300€ for a 45 min flight which I had booked for Rs 2500. For the sake of comparison, air France quoted 100€ for the Delhi Paris flight. Keep in mind that I had no check-in luggage.

So, here I was with my bicycle, with almost a week's preparation and I could not take it along.
It's just sad to see how inconsiderate the service is. It's sad that this is my review of my country's flag bearing airline."

The main problem with Air India, in my view, is their inability to stay on schedule. At Bengaluru, boarding was on time and so was pushback. However we arrived in Kolkata almost 45 minutes late. Air India must address this issue of delayed flights."

And this time, we were mentally prepared. But, they must improve! They have to maintain time. It is not difficult. They have to change the mindset. Next, they have to simplify systems. Just because they are overmanned, they need not put people on unnecessary activities. We observed one of such things during our flight. At the boarding point, one person was tearing off the counterfoil from the ticket [many airlines have done away with this, some airlines just scan the bar code], then he handed it over to another person, a third person was noting down something. We were allowed inside the plane only after the whole process was over. So, there was a long queue. Similarly, the process inside the plane was slow. Agility was missing.
You have many good things. Good leg space, good food. Take advantage and make it the best airlines in the country. Improve and prove to the authorities that you are not for sale. You can make profit. Just remember,customers are important. Wish yoiu the very best!"

1. When it's time to do web check in (if you are willing to do a seat selection), it's SITA PSS website will be down.

2. Finally if you see the Web-Check in working, it won't let you do so because its web check in portal say that your passport (with validity of up to 10 years, which was
issued a month ago) is not valid travel.

3. You never know when will you board the flight. Once I boarded 1:45 AM flight at 9:30 am. No apologies by Airline, they don't care even if you humiliate them by running rallies and shouting slogans at the airport. You will never be asked for any food/water/accommodation. You will never be given any reason for delay or any facility that other airlines provide in these scenarios.

4. Customer care service is disgusting. When you dial the number, you will be informed that your turn will come in 10 minutes. That 10 minutes could go up to 90 minutes and still you won't get a chance to speak to customer service.

5. It is very common that Vegetarian Food gets over on the flight even if you had opted for a Vegetarian food. You will be kept hungry on the flight. If you get lucky, you may get some food. Air hostess will say that you are getting food from their share.

6. Bathrooms are mostly clogged. You won't feel like using the bathroom.

7. Seats have horrible situation. You won't be able to push it back ward.

8. Headphones won't work and Touchscreen won't turn on."

I felt like the plane hadn't been cleaned properly before boarding (maybe as I was in the back row). The food was pretty awful, served in kindergarten-like plastic boxes.

A couple of weeks later, I needed to change my return flight segment. As I was several hours from an Air India office I tried to call their international office. Each time the automation said the line was very busy and I would wait around 10 mins. I spent over 4 hours trying to change my flight during 4 calls. I waited 60 mins on one occasion and then, having explained what I wanted, was transferred to another number with more waiting. When I tried to pay for the fare change, I was told this was not possible whilst calling using Skype - so I had to start all over again. I bought phone credit and £15 vanished without being able to speak to anyone.

It was like being back in the dinosaur age of air travel. I was not able to change the reservation online, only use this call centre number. One agent alone was not able to handle a simple ticket change. There was no information about real wait time, or how payment could be accepted. When I asked to speak with a manager, I spoke to someone who had no idea how to handle customer complaints.

I received an online feedback form about the flight, but it was so basic I couldn't even leave details about the cleanliness of the plane.

Straight away I will mention that AloTrip had been superb throughout this ordeal. The flights outwards were AI333 from Bangkok to New Delhi then 2 hours to transfer to AI111 to London. Perfect, or so I thought. Then on 28th May they changed the flight connections to 45 mins in New Delhi. It is not possible to do a transfer in less than 1 hour and 30 mins!! I emailed Customer Services at Air India to see if they would honour the connection. No reply!!
The flights were later put back to the original timings. Happy days or so I thought. Then on 2nd July they changed the timings again to 45 mins transfer. Bear in mind I am flying on the 8th July!! I emailed Customer Services marking it Urgent and yup, you guessed rightly, no reply. I then phoned them and you can forget the "" you are in a queue and will be answered in 10 mins"" etc. I tried time and time again with one time over an hour and still no reply!! I attempted to call all numbers and some I found for offices in London and yet again,no replies!!
The upshot of this is having had discussions with AloTrip and looking at alternatives, I cancelled the tickets and rebooked elsewhere. I then emailed a complaint about lack of replies to emails to the feedback section of Air India and yup, yet again no reply!!
AloTrip handled the refund for me and I did get a full refund less a small admin charge from Air India.

So three flights with Air India this week then. Really poor food, and I mean poor. Urinal blocks in the sinks, sagging chair cushioning, threadbare upholstery and malfunctioning seat recline mechanisms.
If you are used to flying on one of the more top notch major airlines or simply from a civilised country and are used to being comfortable don't bother flying Air India. It will disappoint..."

Economy",Flight to Gandhinagar India,"Recently I flew from the U.S to Ahmedabad India on Air India. Like many others, I was skeptical based on the reviews online. I read many before flying the airline but unfortunately was unable to select my own airline since this was a business trip. Overall, I had a pleasant experience on the flight. The staff was incredible friendly and easy on the eyes which was good since the flight was nearly 17 hours. The seats were standard so not super luxurious for the length of the flight but served their purpose. The in-flight entertainment was updated to offer multiple English movies and music. My only criticism is the lack of available WiFi on Air India flights, which I read they are working to rectify. Even the meals (which were plentiful) were tasty. I'm not sure they were distributed based on our pre-selected preferences since I was given a vegetarian meal at each round, but all were good.

My return flight plane was slightly larger and updated. However, I did have an issue with my luggage being damaged on the return. I've contacted the Customer Service department but nothing as of yet. I purchased brand new luggage for the trip and one of my suitcases was complete destroyed on the return. Even the leather was stripped off as if the bag was caught in a machine. At least I got all my stuff, (except the games I forgot in my overhead bin).

Overall though I'd say it was a successful flight with no real issues. Definitely exceeded my expectations based on the reviews I read prior to departing."

Next I found that my in flight entertainment was not functioning, The woman sitting next to me said hers was not functioning either. When we brought this problem to the attention of the flight attendant, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away. It wasn't easy to get the attention of the flight attendants either. They spent most of their time seated on stools in the galley talking and laughing with each other. We were offered water by the attendants only with food service, although the flight from SFO to Delhi was 16 + hours long. The Indian food wasn't all that good either, rather overcooked and dried out around the edges. The Indian woman sitting next to me didn't eat hers. On the flight back my in flight entertainment was also not working. Although this time there was no garbage stuck between the seat and the window, at some point during the flight I felt a strange object between my seat and the person next to me. It turned out to be the bare foot of the woman behind me. That woman and her family appeared to be sick and coughed throughout the trip spewing spittle over me, and my food when I was eating, for the entire trip. My request to the flight attendant to ask the woman and her family to cover their faces when coughing received no response."

The knee room in Air India is the max amongst most airlines. However the service is most atrocious, in fact worse than low cost airlines. No food or beverage, water only if asked for repeatedly. Add to that the very poor quality of announcements and delayed flight, what you get is a disaster of an experience. Further, no urgency on part of the staff. So, my advice is don't pay anything extra to travel by air India. If it's cost competitive, you may go for it."

If you fly via them, the trip to Dharamsala is either free or costs a pittance AND you get to take your whole 30kg of luggage. IF you fly another airline, you will have to purchase another ticket to Dharamsala, (who wants 12-15 hrs of lugging your luggage around if it can be done for free and you get there in 1.5 hours), then, you will pay extra baggage over 20kg. so when I want to go to the mountains, I always fly Air India. (food is better from your home town to india than return) (but by then you will be used to it all). if that doesnt make sense....= air india will give you a free flight to dharamsala (or nearly free), and you can take all your luggage. If you fly another airline, you pay another ticket to fly to Dharamsala and you will end up paying extra baggage over 20kg.

Flights were on time and the food was reasonably Ok. The major concerns were the comfort of seat, were you have no cushions, and the entertainment was horrible, the remotes were broken, and the touch screens has no response, and more over you have to live with the very few movies (10-15 hindi and english, regional languages are 2-3, that too at least 5 years old). I do not think of sitting in a plane for 15 hours with out any entertainments? The staff has the same attitude that they had 15 years ago, nothing has changed. I could see the screws fallen off from the seats. Toilets are not having any required stuff, no soap, tissue papers or creams to wash your hands, most of the toilets are not at all cleaned!
The ground staff at all scanning places are the worst especially, in Delhi, long queues and they just chat each other, never bothered to look at the bags that are piled on the conveyer. There was only one scanner for the entire people standing in queue! International area you have ask for help, absolutely no proper sign boards, and all your english questions are answered in HINDI, I felt pity for the Americans traveling through Delhi airport (unless they start learning Hindi).

We had flown down to Cochin in economy on a brand new Boeing 787, which was clean and the economy experience was fine. On check in for the return flight in Cochin we were offered an upgrade to Business for half the normal cost and decided to pay the £75 as it was quite a long flight. The upgrade supposedly entitled us to priority boarding, business class seating and service on board and priority luggage delivery on arrival. The boarding was a complete shambles with no control over the order in which passengers boarded. The Business cabin ( on an A320) was absolutely filthy - I have never seen an aircraft in such a disgusting state in over 50 years of air travel ( see photo of our overhead panel below). On board service was ‘perfunctory’ with poor food sloppily served. The cabin crew made no attempt to make the so-called Business class passengers welcome or well looked after. On arrival we were directed to a ‘special’ luggage carousel for priority luggage. The only thing that was special was that the luggage failed to appear. After 40 minutes of fruitless questions to disinterested staff I found the carousel onto which the ‘non-priority’ luggage from our flight had been delivered. Most passengers had their bags when the so-called priority baggage finally appeared around an hour after we had landed. Attempts to complain were met with ‘buck passing’ and a suggestion to speak to the duty manager in the Air India desk in arrivals. This I tried to do only to be fobbed off with the answer ‘complain through the website’. I was then detained by the police for being in a departure area without a ticket for a departure that day! You really couldn’t make it up. I will never fly Air India again and I offer this not as a criticism of India generally (it is a wonderful country), but solely of Air India. Even BA back to London felt like 6* luxury by comparison with the Air India shambles."

I was traveling for work and didn't book the flight myself, but in the future I will be much more involved in the selection of airline. Bottom line if you don't have time to read any further: avoid this airline at all costs. I can't really begin to express how sub-par (miserable, really) the experience was, from the brusque flight crew, to the worn out and stained seats that offer no support, to the clunky and antiquated ""interactive"" screens to the horrible food. I might have been able to forgive all that if only they offered wifi on board. They do not, and apparently there is no pre-booking notice to travelers about this deficiency. I flew SFO-DEL round trip, which is a 16 hour non-stop flight each way. Not having wifi meant I lost two full days of productivity. Nothing in terms of the price of the ticket can compensate for that. I mentioned my dissatisfaction to a colleague, and learned that they are actually worse on domestic flights: ""Air India flight from Kolkata to Delhi, I was given a boarding pass with the seat number: 27C. I walked onto the plane to find that there were only 26 rows of seats on the plane! Soon there were 10 of us standing around cramped for room at the back of the plane because it turns out they had handed out boarding passes for seats in the non-existent rows 27 and 28. It took them well over an hour to sort this out and they still couldn't sort it out. After an hour of standing in that cramped space, one of the AI staff confidently hand-wrote 6F on my boarding pass. So I moved my carry on luggage from the overhead space in the back to one closer to row 6 only to find someone sitting in seat 6F and she had a boarding pass that said 6F. So I took matters into my own hands and sat down in an empty seat. Sure enough, a passenger soon showed up with a boarding pass for my seat. I directed him to the AI staff who re-seated him.""

Unfortunately, I had to wipe down my seat handles with the linty wash cloth we were handed out for refreshing. I felt the cabin was not cleaned well after the previous flight. The inflight magazines were grimy and the window had food stains. The seats were not comfortable flat bed on the flight I took. Mind you, the price was not cheap but it was a direct flight from Washington to Delhi that was convenient for me.
However, the inflight staff were polite and kind. The food was average and service at the check in counter was good.
Unless I have no other choice, I would avoid taking this airline in the future. Hopefully they can improve their service as the flight route is a convenient one for me."

Air India has the absolute worst aircrafts with the most ancient entertainment systems on International flights that really don't help in distracting you from realizing that you're trapped in a flying cupboard, at best. But that is a mere inconvenience in the harrowing experience that Air India considers to be an acceptable journey.

After missing my connecting flight at Delhi International Airport, thanks to the brilliantly inefficient airport security, and spending the night at the airport, when it was time to check-in to my new connecting flight, the Air India personnel at the counters were extremely curt, unhelpful and uncooperative about checking in my luggage that was already cleared from my previous flight.

Upon boarding my next flight, I was welcomed to an uncleaned seat and food tray. Once I finally landed at my intended destination, Air India managed to lose one of my checked bags, which I was reconciled with after 6 days.

This experience has definitely turned my family, friends and me away from Air India as future customers."

As I had a connecting flight and my luggage along with my friend's was tagged together. My Friend received her luggage but I didn't. Then I had to report it to the missing baggage counter. My disappointment started from next day. I had to follow up for my luggage and after they finally found it,they were not courteous enough to give a call to me and inform the same. After several phone calls,the person stopped responding the call. I had to go back all the way to airport to get my luggage. After reaching there too, when asked about my bag, they staff without even checking inside told that they have not found my bag. When I told them that I will go inside and personally check my bag,one guy went and brought my bag. This clearly a case of negligence and irresponsibility. It was my first experience in Air India and probably the last too."

And Lo Behold. within few minutes, one after the other the officers started to leave and we were left with only one officer. the lone officer was further troubled by a couple of ""family/group"" travelers who had huge number of baggage which were beyond their allowance and first they tried re-distributing the luggage and then were advised to pay for additional baggage which they found unacceptable and argued away. In the meantime the queue started lengthening and by now built up to 250 plus passengers. I had enough time but obviously there were others who had arrived just in time and were getting restive. a very many of the air India ground staff were loitering around. when i pointed out the pathetic situation all of them expressed helplessness and attempted absolutely nothing. they simply stated that it was the time when the shift change happened and the incoming staff would shortly take their charge. the few minutes of process took more than half an hour for me. As I said, I had ample time but what unnerved me was the apathy of the Air India ground staff. This organisation clearly has a culture where everyone is ""assured"" of their job irrespective of their insensitive approach. They know that it is the government which is footing the bill of their salary and not the customer. Which is why the arrogance and the apathy!

Hence he impatiently tried to cross me in the queue at which the clerk mr. francis politely requested him to wait for his chance. almost at the same time the counter to my left got free and i requested this gentleman to check-in his luggage from that counter if he was in a hurry. he thanked me and started towards it but was beaten to it by another traveller. in the ensuing confusion, the counter clerk very rudely pulled him up. the clerk chided him, stood up from his seat and lectured him for a full minute at the top of his voice. as if that was not enough, the clerk refused to check him in. i had to step in then and assertively pointed out to the the clerk that he cannot refuse services and should understand the state of mind of that gentleman as well. after some arguing, the clerk relented but did not stop his ranting. the gentleman was aghast and felt demeaned, naturally. i tried getting the name of the clerk but he wouldn't give it to me.
one could experience a huge contrast between mr. francis who helped me and his colleague. isn't the airline responsible for such arrogant and insensitive behaviour of the personnel who actually are supposed to help the customers???"

First, the flight was delayed as the airlines wanted to get more customers from other connecting flights. Second, Flight attendants were swamped because of the previous issue so weren’t able to help customers with their seatings; most people were talking to other passengers that they were on their seats. Third, in New Delhi we were told by the airport staff that our flight was moved forward so they needed to get us through check ASAP. As we didn’t know any better, we followed them; one of the older passenger was asked to sit in a wheelchair so as to speed up the check in process. As we get through the check, which would have taken us no more than half an hour but was done in 15minutes, the staff member starts harassing us for pounds and 1000 Indian rupees tip. At this point we were all confused so I go straight to customer help desk to ask if the flight was moved forward, the advisor says it’s on schedule and nothing was changed. I find this disgraceful as passengers don’t necessarily have the correct information and are highly likely to trust he airport staff if they say we have to rush as flights have been changed.

Last but not the least, we all arrive in Kathmandu but our luggage hasn’t. The Kathmandu airport staff say that there was a mix up at Heathrow and should arrive by late afternoon the next day. Our contact details were taken; luckily I had phone number of a local person in Kathmandu, now my question is what if a passenger did not know anyone in Kathmandu or had the right contact details to provide them, what happens then?

Obviously my luggage doesn’t arrive for another 2 days. At this point I have had to buy fresh underwear and other essentials as all my belongings were in my checked in luggage. Now my girlfriend found that Indian Airlines provides compensation to passengers if it’s delayed for more than 48 hours which I go to claim twice but to no avail."

Here the best part, among the Domestic Flights in India only AirIndia allows 25kg checkin luggage and 7kg hang carry. It’s worth it rather than 12-15 kilos on other flights and secondly only AirIndia goes to the International Airport in Mumbai. It’s best if you’re traveling out of India and need a domestic flight to carry more luggage.

We chose them because they were offering the best times for both trips (but they changed them later from 8:40 in the morning to 2:40 in the middle of the night - and they do this apparently regularly). On both flights (actually al 4 flights because there is a stop over in Delhi) the online checkin was not working - as a result my family of four were spread all over the plane. In one case they booked as in row 23, but the aircraft only has 21 rows. So their IT is simply not working, everything is utmost slow (it took us 20 Minutes to check in at the desk in Colombo). The aircraft from Colombo to Delhi is really old and dirty and this in combination with a non working IT ... you don´t believe that they really care about technical standards and safety. The entertainment system didn´t work on both flights from FFM to Delhi. Every passenger needed numerious resets to get the minimum going- the minimum means a really small collection of outdated movies. I think even 15 years ago other airlines had better entertainment systems . This is clearly not acceptable. Sleeping was also difficult because we had numerious kids crying on all flights. The only positive aspect: some of the staff (not all) tried to do their best to solve the problems.
So at least for us: never AIR INDIA again no matter how good their flight times are or how cheap they are. it is a shame that they are a member of the star alliance group."

I decided to call them, because the connecting flight was planned 20 minutes after arrival in Kolkata. Oh that’s not working they said. They can reroute me on the flight at 8:00 am. Ok now I have to wake up at 4 am, but ok. If no other choice...
Next message came, Sorry the flight from Kolkata to Dhaka also delayed now by one hour.
Than I called again to book me back on the first flight, because time seems enough now. But that one was ful in the meantime.
So I arrived in Kolkata early with the result that I could not go inside, because immigration starts only 3 hours before the flight. Finally I have to sit nearly 8 hours at the dirty and crowdy airport in Kolkata. Cancelled meetings. A ful day lost.
Ok it can happen, that a flight must be cancelled. But from other airlines I get a good and helpful service normally, especially if you book a expensive business class ticket.
But air India: no. They just always said, that is the best we can do... means nothing!
It is not the first time the trouble with them and I saw on the board, around half of there flights were either delayed or cancelled.
Seems they drive now the same policy as Air Berlin, shortly before they bancrupt: if the flights not ful, they will cancel some and move the passengers to other flights to save money.

We were told by the Rome check-in operative that our luggage would be transferred at Delhi and we wouldn't need to handle the luggage there. Furthermore, he told us that we only had to go to the departure gate and not to the transfer desk. He couldn't have been more wrong!

On arrival at Delhi, we had our visas checked and followed the signs for Domestic Transfers/ Baggage Pickup. As we were passing the luggage belts we decided to see if our luggage had been accidentally (or otherwise) put on the belt. Lo and behold it had been. What a lucky call that had been.

We and all our bags were then directed through Customs into the Arrivals Lounge where we had to check-in our luggage again.

Before checking-in, we had a wonderful coffee at Costa Coffee where we ripped the luggage labels off off the suitcases so the baggage handlers wouldn't get confused. Big mistake!

At the Domestic Transfer desk we told the clerk about the misinformation from the Rome Air India desk and how we nearly lost our luggage. He wasn't interested. When we told him that other futere passengers from Rome needed to be given the correct International to Domestic transfer procedure, he gave us the Air India web address.

We put our bags on the belt and off the went to near oblivion. Fortunately the clerk noticed the lack of labels and berated us for taking them off, 'Don't you know the transfer procedure? '"

I travel at least 4 countries a year and 've traveled in low cost latin american airlines and european airlines but I am surprised that the flagship carrier of India from the most popular hub in USA was the worst flight I've ever experienced.

Before boarding, there is an option to book your seat and to your surprise at the check in , the agent changes the seat, though its the same flight, meaning the seating structure did not change and its not a new flight or different from what's shown when you booked the ticket. This happened not only with me but other passengers as well, so I wonder why they even give an option to book seat when passengers can't retain them.

The flight is quite older in fact oldest and there are no standards for restrooms, in fact, public restrooms in India appeared more hygenic and cleaner than those on this flight.

There was some smell in cabin which is expected for long flights , so usually it's a common practice for airlines like Qatar and Emirates to fill the cabin with air freshners before the flight takes off and when I asked for some air fresheners, Air India staff said they don't do it and dont ask me why :-)

Coming to entertainment, lets just assume , there is none. No one knows when the touch screens work and when they won't. From the media collection, hardly any good movies and most of them don't play, so, it's almost like there is no entertainment at all.

No maps are shown on the monitors, and with seat monitors not functioning, you would not have any idea on where you are or when you are going to land or how much of the flight time is remaining, you always have to wait for announcements from captain.

Above all, what surprised me most is that, it's a full flight, so, even with such high revenue why Air India is not focused on bringing some better service to this route.

Hopefully they will work on it, if not, I am sure, in no time, they will have to fly empty planes."

My flight to London to Mumbai was diverted to Delhi with apparent problems on the runway due to weather and because of another airline overshot the runway the previous night. This was aware of this problem even before it departed from London but we were only told only half an hour before we were about to land that the flight is now being diverted to Delhi. Another 2.5 hours flight. Upon Landing at Delhi we were told that once Mumbai clears we will fly back. After 2 hours in the aircraft on the ground they decided we will all have to disembark and make alternative arrangement to our destination.
We were taken to the terminal a very small briefing by one of the staff who did not even have the courtesy wait for all the passengers as some of us were still trying to get our baggage. To re-route our flight they a two staff serving 350 passengers.
As there is no queuing system you can imagine what a nightmare it was.
During all this time no courtesy services were offered by the Airline .
Even when departing from Goa to Mumbai my flight was delayed due to bad weather,
the flight was to depart at 18.30 hrs , all other domestic airlines were announcing the departure of there flight well before the departure time . Air India announces delay in departure exactly at 18.30 .
This Airline really needs to improve its services and mentioning in flight entertainment
its a joke half the equipment on flight does not work, even connection of headset missing. I was told by the inflight attendance that they have reported it several times but the management just ignores their comments.

Economy",Air India… Truly Indian! - for all the bad things,"I would include AI0506 Delhi to Bangalore also in this journey.
I will try to objectively list everything that is wrong with this flight. I am a heavy person, 15 kilo overweight 187 cm height.

I paid 200 dollars less than Qatar Airways for the same journey. Below you can see if it was worth it.

Plus points:
1) Acceptable service. I always got help on the flight, though not making me feel cared.
2) 2 check in bags of 23 kilos

Minus points:
1) You can check in 48 hours before your flight. Why do we do that? To select meal and seat - for a long journey. I tried to navigate their horrible webpage for check in. It is hidden somewhere. After you get there, you have a drop down menu to choose start city. Stockholm not listed! Looked everywhere else, and by chance after 3 hours somewhere saw a text entry ""If checking in from Stockholm, click here"" Takes you to SAS webpage where nothing happens, booking reference is invalid.
2) Tried checkin through phone app. Asks to create an account, cannot use Star Aliance membership. Then add trip. Then try checking in -- some java programming error.
3) Tried calling call centres. There are 100 options and when to call whom. Not one number! None of them work. Spent another 10 pounds on this and 2.5 hours.
4) 4th attempt, calling directly to a Delhi call centre, I got some person who spoke out of a script and had to yell to get a check in possibility. She blocked my seat over the phone. 35K, apparently a window seat.
5) Got to airport, kiosks do not work for boarding pass. ARN airport personnel just heard ""Air India"" and sent me to a counter chuckling that it never works.
6) Checked my seat at check in counter, they gave me both middle seats. They said call centre had put in a request for seat change. Follow up comment in their system was ""seat denied"". Reason the lady said -- ""flight is fully booked"". Try at the gate.
7) Went to gate. Asked for 35K. They said, flight is booked. I can still give you 39D -- window. I took it. Came and checked seat map -- right next to toilet and last row, less leg room than even usual seats! Went back and asked, they said ""we have one seat left 37 D"" somehow ""one seat""s kept appearing.
8) Flight started off 10 min late -- reason: ""they forgot some paperwork""
9) Flight had 2 seats per person. Nowhere close to fully booked.
10) I changed around a few seats and somehow settled on an emergency exit seat! My luck! But the entertainment monitor kept breaking down and had to be reset 6 times.
11) I changed 4 seats because of one problem or another. Apparently the last row is for the crew! So they can sleep? when has this been the norm? Was asked to get up and leave
12) The plane was dirty, old head rest covers, oil and food on the arm rests, windows and on the back of seats, old napkins..yuck!
13) The crew were all dressed in different colours, looked like they had just gotten off 2 other back to back journeys just before coming to us. The people looked ugly and more like ""service men"" waiting to cater to every whim of every passenger (Indian passengers are really exploitative!). They commanded no respect, there was no aura of control or neatness or respect with any of them, except one.
14) Food was imported from UK. Horrible food. They have removed salad and bread, downsizing the meal. The quality of the rice and the curry itself was horrible. I would not eat that even if I were hungry and on a plane..... wait, I was! Yeah gave it back half eaten.
15) Had to pick up bag at Delhi airport, where they kept displaying ""Last bag on belt"" which made the people confused and panic for a terribly long time.
16) Had to go through some underground bunker for checking in to domestic flight to Bangalore. Hot humid, packed, crying children, confusion. Luggage specialists being the kings of queues and laws in that room. Random instructions and rules, to show that they are powerful. A 4 man elevator to transport people after check in to security check, for a 200 people flight!
17) Bangalore flight was late by 30 minutes, sitting on the tarmac, no explanation to passengers.
18) Horrible toilets on both flights, not maintained, not stocked with supplies. Indians already have horrible toilet etiquette, if they do not maintain some vigil, there will be a splatter of poop on the toilet seat, like I saw. Learn something from Bangalore airport toilet crew! Idiots...
19) Horribly placed head rests which cause a neck pain. they cannot be moved up or down really.
20) Not enough blankets or pillows. Crew just say ""that is all you can get/ go check at your seat and come back"". On the other hand,there are sacks of pillows and blankets in the over head compartments, taking up room so that hand bags cannot be stored!

Now.. I think I have said everything here that made me never want to travel on this airline again. I was so happy with this service when it started almost exactly 2 years ago and have been using it since then! I think the company, running under loss, is underpaying their staff and downsizing their service quantity and quality still trying to maintain a facade of regalia of the Maharaja. But the Maharaja has long departed and his paper cut out stands there bowing to us, maybe in shame?"

I thought everything was fine and I planned some appointments at Bangalore on that day.
I checked my flight booking through their website 5 days before the boarding date (Aug 7) and found the booking was cancelled without any notice to me. I asked Air India what was happened and they answered they had some payment settlement trouble and they cancelled the booking.
I asked them to resume the orginal booking again and showed willingness to make the payment again because,
1. The booking was once confirmed.
2. They did not send me any notice about booking cancellation.
3. The payment trouble was not my fault.

They admitted my claim was true, but what they said was just to make a new booking. Making new booking costed me more than double (almost triple) and seemed to me quite ridiculous.
I asked them again to resume the booking, but they did not show me any additional solutions nor any apology about their procedure and I was kept ignored just like I was an evil claimer.

I am a frequent traveller and I have been made flight ticket booking hundreds of times. This is first time that once confirmed booking is cancelled by an airline company without prior notice or cumtomer's consent.

On top of everything else, the airline (like the other airlines in India) have very limited baggage allowances on domestic flights, so you are forced to pay excessive excess baggage fees, if you are a foreign tourist traveling from overseas! Whereas you might arrive in the country with the typical allowance of 46 kg (two 23 kg bags), once you arrive you are suddenly expected to lose 21 kg of luggage (with their 25 kg baggage allowance) or pay the equivalent of 7 USD per kg, in excess fees! I ended up paying in the course of 3 domestic flights, more than 160 USD in excess fees, more than the cost of all 3 plane tickets, combined! Unfortunately, none of the other transport options is practical, due to the state of the roads, rails and the great distances between cities, in India!"

If you wanted anything to eat or drink (food was inedible) you had to wait until someone came past as the buzzer did not work. The breakfast we were offered was a dry piece of cake, something that resembled a croissant (which I chose) or a chocolate muffin. I took one bit of the croissant and spat it out it was revolting. We went for 10 hours without being offered a meal and when I asked for one, it was like ""seriously you want some service"" attitude. When we reached Delhi we were forced to go through a baggage with the nastiest individuals it was a full search even though we were just transiting. Now I am not talking about the usual search when you get to or near your gate and you are asked to open you bag, I am talking ""take everything out of your back pack, asked about every object in in, having the goods snatched from me and thrown into a plastic bucket to go through the scanner. The goods were literally snatched from me, I was then asked to step behind a curtain to be scanned by one of the most miserable people I have ever met, actually being pushed to move into the ""correct position"" without exchanging one word with me. When I came out, I was asked to pack my bag (its contents had been piled into one plastic sorter even though 3 went through when I unpack and was told to move out of the way, at this point I did not realise that 3 pieces of my luggage missing (I was literally shaking & in tears) 2 evening bags and a soft packing bag all of which contained my jewellery (I always carry it with me) I didn't see this until I arrived home and started to unpack. I then quickly rang both the airline and the airport they gave me 6 different numbers ""as they were not responsible for lost and found albeit that the dept I rang"" - I am still waiting on a response after I was finally given an email address to send my query to. I have now lost precious air-looms that cannot be replaced and about $4K worth of additional jewellery. Not only will I never travel with them again, I will be taking this up with the Indian embassy. My advice, if you are traveling alone or a Female don't go near them. I booked it because it was a last minute trip to Europe and they were the carrier bringing me back from Milan. On the trip over the first leg was with Malaysian airlines who you never expect a lot from but they are friendly and accommodating, The second leg was with Oman Airlines and I have to say they are one of the best I have ever been on. The beds are comfortable, you are given a complete privacy screen they come and ask you constantly if you need anything and it was pristine. Absolutely no comparison. If I am able to use Oman airlines for a full journey in the future I wouldn't hesitate to book. I have been distraught about my Jewellery since Saturday and there has been no follow up they didn't even ask my name, what flight I was on what seat I was in...! It was only on Sunday when I happened across someone what seemed like they were will to help but the email they gave me bounced back, I have tried a slightly different permutation and it did not bounce back so I am sitting in abeyance not knowing if any action will be taken. I know that the insurance company will ask if I have contacted them before they will take action however I actually don't know.
Long and drawn out review as I really think forewarned is forearmed so if you want to travel cheap and are will to accept the fact that you should be grateful to even get a seat then try your luck, if you want a business class experience you won't get it on this airline."

Business Class",The airline has no business being in business particularly in Business Class,"I have flown Air India on two different occasions over the last two years both as a consequence of a last minute emergency that left the airline as the only choice to fly to and from India (my regular choice is United or Lufthansa).

First the ""good points"". On both occasions, the cabin crew provided excellent service and are always eager to please which is in stark contrast to many US airlines where the idea of service is an alien concept thanks to the employee unions in the US who think customers and owners are secondary to a business. However, it is all downhill from here as the crew can only do so much with aircraft that belong to a third world country (at least in this regard India is not one with Indigo and the erstwhile Jet Airways prove).

The negatives: Let's start with the lounge in JFK: A tiny room with a comically roped off part for ""first class"" has a damp air with an overpowering smell of overcooked Indian food that has been left to stew on chaffing dishes. The TVs in the room are from a few decades ago with couches strewn about haphazardly leaving travelers (business class) to trip over each while they balance food from the ""buffet"" on their hands in trying to get to the couches.

Now the lounge in New Delhi: Set to one side at the upper level of the international departure area it has a desk manned (at least in this instance) by a mostly Hindi speaking semi-gruff individual who could barely string two sentences in English (despite the noise from all those strident Hindi proponents, it is by no means spoken across the India and is not their national language). Anyway, once past Mister Charming, a similar stale buffet of Indian food in an admittedly larger area awaits. The lounge seating too is more spread out but with furniture that someone put there a decade ago and forgot to replace. Getting from the lounge to the boarding gate requires clearing another security hurdle apparently per US regulations only to find a long wait. The perhaps in a revenge of the proletariat the airline decides that Economy passengers are should board first! That left the paying seething! Incidentally, there are more non-paying passengers than paying! Ah! the thrills of working for an employer with an endless capacity for deficit financing!

Lastly the business class cabin: It actually is very spacious but with an ante-diluvian configuration of 2-3-2. In the middle 3 abreast seats a tiny fan can be raised for privacy! Can't make it up!. Once in the seat, nothing works. Well almost nothing as the seat does recline a full 180 degrees but that's it.

The video ""entertainment"" is and has been kaput for years as evidenced by the two flights over the last two years. The staff gamely tries to fiddle with it when asked knowing fully well it does not work! Then again, they are very service oriented even if they have been given nothing to work with.

There are no amenity kits although a pair of slippers is provided. Toothbrushes and paste are in the toilets and presumably replenished when over.

The food is shamefully tasteless given how tasty Indian food can be. Worse, on AI 101 DEL-JFK, they offered a ""snack"" on take off and work up passengers about 4 hours later to offer dinner when most passengers were deep in slumber!

Lastly, the actual seats were worn out with one in front (see photo) actually having a screw sticking out! I guess suing Air India for any injury that may ensue is not an option."

Lounge coffee machine is broken. Lounge has mosquitoes. There were pigeons pecking on leftover food on the ground. No drinks service except on first meal. On the way back, they reassigned seat because apparently assigned seat didn't recline, and they put me and children on different rows.

You need to take a serious look at your lounge especially Delhi being one of your major hub. This is your front for the airlines. Your lounge is too inferior and not reflective of your airline. Please take a look at your food offfering. Apart from stale and only Indian food (i like Indian food but the quality is bad) you have no other choices except flies. Your staff are totally inadequate and on their phone all the time. No passion for their job. On the many occasions I have been there, I would eat at the restuarants and even the other lounges which are of a way better quality. So if you are from AI, please do something about this for your airline and for Indian pride at least.

Finally, I have good things to say about the flight itself. Whilst not anywhere near Singapore Airlines, Air India's J class is comfortable. Seats are wide enough but everything else fails - seat maintainence is bad, entertainment is also inadequate and inflight service needs some serious motivation. They all look unhappy.

Overall a very poor experience. Adequate trains from Delhi to Allahabad, would utilize them next time."

The Economy seats are so narrow and hardly there is any leg room. Luckily the flight duration was only 5 hours. No one with the right mind should fly this Airbus Aircraft. The toilets are right at the back. If you are some one like me who need to use the facility, forget it.If it is a night flight, then get through the people who are trying to get a wink is like eternity.

I would highly recommend flying on Air India even if many people think it is the worst, just don’t care. It was good and I reached Mumbai a few minutes early. It also has the shortest flights from USA to India. Thanks to Air India for giving the most incredible service in economy class. I would recommend flying on Air India again soon. In my opinion, it is even better than SilkAir and Singapore Airlines. I really recommend Air India."

This flight got cancelled and merged with AI 624 which was to leave from Domestic terminal. I reached the domestic terminal with a web-checked in boarding pass for AI 0024. The security personnel directed me to international terminal. In the international terminal entrance there was an air India staff checking the boarding pass of every passenger and he didn't tell me that the merged flight AI 624 will depart from domestic terminal. It took nearly an hour to get out of the international terminal where Air India staff was not at all helpful. The security personnel felt pity on my plight and allowed me to get out. Later I got booked on AI 191 after an argument with the AI counter staff. The ETD of AI 0024 was 18:00 Hrs and I finally left Delhi by AI 191 ETD 21:00 Hrs. Horrible experience!!

I sat like a statue for 5.5 hours with my mobile and wallet in my 2 hands as there was no space (like net/pocket in back of the seat in front of me). While such aircrafts( A320 or 321) are ok to fly domestic, how can AI do so for international routes. Can anyone reply where does one keep small belongings such as the ones I mentioned here? There site/portal is horrible. Their local phone connections in Singapore are most terrible. Why are they in this business when they are nor even making money? as for myself, I will not even not fly again, I also feel like asking all my friends also not to fly AI.
For Business class upgrade, they ask you to pay money first and they will, then, confirm later. Can you imagine when? They confirm at the time of boarding.Then why do they take money days in advance for the upgrade. Is anybody in govt aware of this 'loot'?"

It is not that there the service was lacking, but it was without character. A bland trip without any outstanding difference between economy and Business class apart from the seat space. They would do better if someone who pays for service tells them what they are lacking. A simple issue like cheap quality toilet paper. I have seen quicker service by the few attendants in economy, Maybe its attitude when Air India promote staff to serving Business class. I would not recommend Air India for this class of travel."

My earlier flight had got cancelled so I booked Air India flight at 1:30pm, (scheduled departure 04:25pm, boarding time 03:50pm) directly from the airport. Gate number wasn't mentioned on the information boards. It just showed flight status ""On time"". No one from the airport information desk had any update from Air India. There was only 1 Air India personnel (who we had to search for almost 20 mins- found him at 04:00pm) who told us that expected gate of arrival is 41A. We ran towards the gate which was almost 15 minutes distance from the information desk, only to find NOTHING. Many of my co-passengers thought the flight has already left the gate and is on the runway waiting to take-off. While the information board still displayed flight status as ""On-time"". It was 05:00pm and we thought we missed the flight. We again went to the information desk and the single person who had told us about the Gate number was missing. There were many other passengers who had bought their Air India tickets (for other destinations) were waiting for answers from the airport information desk, but those employees did not have any update from Air India. Finally, at 6pm, I got a voice message saying that the flight will depart at 6:30pm, but no mention of gate details. At 6:35pm, the gate number was displayed. We all ran towards the gate, but the flight hadn't arrived yet. The plane arrived at the gate at 6:45pm, then the customary cleaning and offboarding was going on. At least at that time we knew we hadn't missed the flight. We finally boarded at 7:30pm and the flight took off at 8pm. Till the time I boarded, I was irritated with all the mismanagement. But then the in-flight experience was way better than other domestic economy flights I had traveled in. Larger leg room, cleaner interiors, free meal (even on a 40mins flight), comfortable seats. I understand the chaos that day due to rains, but Air India should have at least given some information to the passengers about the flight delays. Otherwise, the in-flight experience was the best I had so far, especially for domestic economy category."

However, I have found it to be on schedule most of the time. I have routinely encountered Indigo or Spice Jet flights getting delayed and cancelled, and these are not spoken about, but an Air India flight getting delayed in taking off by about 15 minutes is enough to create an uproar.
The leg space is one of the best in the Airline industry.
They now have smart, suave, ever-smiling stewardesses and stewards.
Food variety on domestic sector, though vegetarian, the flights from Kolkata offer excellent choices, though the ones originating from Delhi lack a proper taste.
The pilots being vastly experienced, the landing operations are extra smooth.
Fantastic airline, though the successive governments are trying their best to destroy this Institution.

Firstly, among all the domestic airlines, i would strongly recommend only Air India!!!

Air India staff takes very good care of wheelchair passengers, unlike some of the other airlines like Vistara and SpiceJet who are so least bothered and negligent in understanding passengers requirements [They are doing service as a big favor on us, too much of attitude]. Hence, i stopped travelling in Vistara and SpiceJet due to some bad experiences while taking wheelchair services for myself and parents.

Coming back to Air India, best staff and even once you are seated on the board, the air hostesses are very kind, cheerful and helpful....Seats in the economy class are clean and spacious compared to other airlines, Good leg room with wonderful ambiance [No A/C Issue at all]. Food they provide is so hygienic and sufficient depending upon the duration of your journey. I always have wonderful experience and i am at peace when i travel by Air India.

Had already experienced the Babudom of this airline when I visited their Safdarjung airport office. it is no different from any other Govt. office of a District with more staff and less visitors but still a long wait before the staff will finish desk work or phonemail to attend. I was told my FF Miles had expired and I could buy them back. These would be sufficient for upgrading me and my wife to business class. However the cost of buyback worked out to more than what I would have to pay at the check-in counter . In any case no seats were free on our dates two/ three months later.
The flight itself was on time and our paid seats next to the door were pre booked. But little did we know that the toilets of this Dreamliner can be a nightmare as the stink was overwhelming. I could see the staff was in a bad mood as none of them ever smiled not even when a cute little kid walked in and said something very funny. My comment that such a beautiful aircraft and that too a couple of years old sadly not maintained as it stank evinced a reply that it was because of the kind of people that travel! The flight took off at about noon and lunch n drinks were promptly served. after five hours my query revealed that the next service was still two hours away however tea could be provided. three hours later a meal /dinner was served. It had refrozen fruits, nearly frozen croissant with a hard cheese slice, a sugary dessert alongwith tea coffee. My comment that food was unpalatable evinced the reply: You can register a complaint, I agree food is bad but this is always the case from Delhi. I did not registers obviously the airline was aware.
The flight got into terminal 2 which is different from the one they used to but there was no announcement to the effect at all. The food on the return journey was better but still not what an international airline would serve. The staff was still in a foul mood as if driving a garbage truck.One girl who came to check on why I was saying food is bad did smile and i complimented her so she told me that they are all overworked.

1) The plane was not fresh.Blankets, speakers, seatbelt were out of place. Washroom accessories were already used. The root cause was obviously that the turnaround time wasnt enough from the previous flight or pure indifference. Hope it was the former otherwise AI has a bigger problem.
2) Economy food is not something you look forward to but this trip AI found a way to make it even worse. Evidence of cost cutting everywhere, fewer choices on the menu, smaller portions and the breakfast ""box"" was atrocious. Surely they can do better than that and only a year back the food was better.
3) Inflight entertainment - Hasnt changed at all and is bad as it has always been I suspect !! The screens are not sensitive and need to be pushed quite strongly for any impact. Once you have managed that and get to the movies menu, old 10 yr old films that you have seen umpteen times greet you . Why bother !!
4) What hasnt changed is that the drinks cart still has good many options. Maybe there is a purpose behind this and the best thing to do is to get sozzled and sleep all the way thru.
5) The 8 hr direct flight time and 45 kgs baggage per person are still the two main draws to fly AI on this route, especially for families. This route is popular and usually fully booked with families travelling to India for vacation. AI needs to improve the service and not make it a milch cow. Hope someone is listening."

I would never do it again, despite the cheap price tag. For a start, I arrived home 28 hours late and lost more than the savings in income. The first leg of the flight was 7 hours late to take off, which meant we missed the connection. I was then told I would have to wait 20 hours for another flight, which went via melbourne - so added an extra leg and several hours on to the trip. They did put me up in a hotel - but the hot water didn't work, and there was a huge window in to the middle of the airport which the curtains didn't really block out, so it was quite a rough night. The staff in the airport were extremely unhelpful, and I doubt I would've even been on the flight I ended up going home on if I hadn't stood at the desk for more than 2 hours being persistent. The plane on the way home was filthy - old food caked on the tray tables, rubbish on the floor. When I eventually got home, my luggage had been lost! I got it back about 24 hours later - again, after a lot of persistent activity on my end. I really wouldn't recommend this flight, even if it is much cheaper than other options."

But the cabin crew made the difference with their understanding of passengers plight in such unforeseen situations . The team was in smiles, caring and concerned. The aircraft Boeing Dreamliner is wonderful in all aspects . The food was delicious and for once, not in excess.

Air India needs to invent and innovate to keep passengers involved and enjoying by showing details of why this long haul, what it implies , how much extra it costs the airline, the world and harmony. The importance of peace time . This is an opportunity to show and share India perspective of issues. And for tech savvy individuals, it is a chance to learn about aviation routes, rules and alternatives.

And to make it worse, the flight I boarded from to kolkota to Dimapur was no better, one of the crew was standing beside my seat, so I politely asked him if he can help me by putting my luggage in the cabin, he looked at me and asked me to help him by lifting it up. Common it was just 5 kilo, I asked him to help me since he was standing beside my seat and I was blocking the way of the other passenger, otherwise I would have not asked him at all. If it would have been some other cabin crew member they would have helped me even without me asking them to do so. So many unpleasant incident happen within this short trip. Oh and last but not the least, the helpline kept me waiting for good 47 minutes and it would have continued if I have not dropped the call as nobody was answering, when the operator clearly told tat I would have to wait for 10 minutes inorder to speak to the executive member.

I asked with 3 different agents and they told me it was around 500-600 indian rupees. When I changed my dollars and was ready to pay, the agent in the departure, baggage section named Seema told me it was 1,000 NRI as soon as she learned that I was from USA. When I told her it showed 600 in the website and few people confirmed she said the pricing changed but website didn’t updated it. She called all the cashier and other agent and made sure they agreed to her. Even the supervisor and Manager were corrupted and agreed to her. I ended up paying $400.00 , I was helpless, travelling alone to meet my sick mother, they showed no mercy. I almost cried but they didn’t let me pay what was stated in the website.

CCU - BOM observations:
- Delayed 35 minutes, not really a big deal
- I paid for an upgraded seat, I was in row 5 AI boards from the rear of the plane, no overhead space when I was allowed to board.
- I have Platinum status with Star Alliance, AI did no pre-boarding of ANY kind.
BOM - EWR
- I called to ensure that my flight was going to be on time, the flight from the previous day was delayed 8 hours, I was told that my flight would be on time.
- Arrived in BOM and was told that my flight was delayed 8 hours, AI was putting me up at a local hotel.
-hotel was horrible, they required more information for checking in then the hotel that I stayed in for my 3 week trip. They took photo copied of my passport, tickets, and took photo's.
-BOM was a nice airport
- Went through the regular security as with all passengers regardless of destination.
-AI, once again, no priority boarding for no one but the elderly which there were plenty.
- Need to go through an additional security check at the gate after having your ticket validated, this included removing shoes, removing all electronics for your carry on bags, and a second pat down.
- The plane interior was filthy, walkway carpet were sticky, seats had stains on, and just trash on the plane.
- In addition to the 8 hour delay there was an additional 1.5 hour delay.
- food was ok but flight attendants were not readily available even when they were paged.
So for a 18 hour flight (3 hours CCu - BOM and then 15 hours from CCU - EWR) I had my lifetime fill of AI. I would rather spend additional hours with another carrier then use AI again. I was not familiar with AI or what their rating was but I will never fly them again, to date this is the worst Star Alliance member that I have ever traveled on. So once and done foe me and AI."

Economy",Comfortable and Very Affordable Flights in the Economy Class,"I have been flying with Air India both from Birmingham, UK, and Frankfurt (Am Main) to New Delhi and back. On all flights Air India operated modern Boeing 787 ""Dreamliner"" aircraft. I love that, as an economy passenger, one can check-in two suitcases with a maximum combined weight of 46kgs (One suitcase can have a maximum weight of 30kgs).
My flight from Birmingham in November 2017 had a slight change of the departure time which Air India communicated very early via e-mail, a text message, and a phone call. A service which I found absolutely exemplarily.
Check-In and Boarding always went very quickly and were handled very professionally. My flight from Frankfurt was dealt with by a ground crew which also works with Lufthansa, and they were very friendly, and highly efficient.
During boarding and disembarking instrumental versions of Bollywood songs are played, which is a nice touch. During the whole flight LED lighting will be used to create a cosy atmosphere.
Economy class seats are very comfortable, one is offered a freshly cleaned blanket, and a set of headphones. The screens are clear and definitely bigger than the ones in the Dreamliners of British Airways or KLM.
What is great is that one can choose a great variety of different meal options. Dishes with meat, as well as various vegetarian options, catering for Hindu and Jain needs.
My flights from Birmingham and Frankfurt left in the evening, and I got a little snack (some peanuts) first, followed just a little bit later by dinner, and a few hours later with a very light breakfast. The food was simple, but good. The portions could be slightly bigger. The Indian desserts were always very nice.
The crew was generous in handing out drinks, and there is a choice between alcoholic drinks like beer, and wine, and juices, as well as soft drinks.
I always enjoy the good selection of recent and classic Bollywood films, but there are also some well-curated Hollywood or other international films available. One can also play music or games on the entertainment system.
Some time after dinner, the lights will be dimmed down for a few hours to allow you to sleep, and soon afterwards breakfast will be served.
I was always astonished how quickly the journey seemed to pass by when I was watching films, especially a longer Bollywoood film, had food, and slept a bit.

Altogether my flights with Air India were a very enjoyable experience. Booked over a month in advance my flights were very affordable, the service was always friendly and efficient, the entertainment was excellent, the food good, and my flights were all on time. I highly recommend Air India and their excellent service!"

I flew from Denver to Washington on United (Code Share) and then Washington to Delhi on Air India. The flight was delayed by a couple hours. Also, the boarding process was a mess. I stood in the line for like 45 min and then they asked me to get a new boarding pass when I was just about to get in, then put me back at the end of the line!

I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi. So, I had to file a delayed baggage claim. The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn't enough staff available to help. Nobody knew what information to provide. After struggling for a couple hours, they filed a delayed baggage report and they told me I'd be receiving my bag within a couple days. After a couple of days, I called them and they told me that they didn't know where the bag was. So, I started calling them everyday. It would take me a couple hours of calling before they would pick up the phone. The phone operators never had any information about what was going on. One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore!!! I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report. But they never responded!

After 10 days, I received a call from a local airport. They told me to come pick up the bag. I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home. As I had a family emergency at home, there was no way I could travel a couple hours to the airport to pick up my bag. So , I told them that I would be filing a police report for stolen bag if they didn't deliver my bag. After several hours, they called me to let me know that they are sending the bag with someone to my home !

On Air India's website, it is mentioned that there is $50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours. I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation, but no one responds. I have been sending them emails every day without any luck!! I recommend everyone to avoid this airline like plague!!! I am never flying with them again!!"

The food is bad and the service is even worse. The flight attendants show up only while serving the food/beverages. Between the services, they just disappear to the back of Air Craft. They are least helpful. What a contrast from the service on Emirates.
The worst part were the toilets. Half way through the flight, the toilet paper was gone, and toilet floor was wet (Hopefully it was just water!). It is the same situation on both flights. When there was 400 passenger and 4 toilets, we expect Air India to anticipate these issues.
Overall the experience was negative. I do not recommend Air India to anyone."

They would not take our check in bags and told to sit anywhere we can. The airline staff were rude unprofessional and didn't care that most of the passengers had connecting flight or train connections,. We were given varied reasons- flooding in Mumbai, bomb threat, Trumps' July 4th parade. The Air India website said the flight was delayed to 1:30pm. United Airlines, through whom I had made the original booking, kept trying to rebook me on a different flight because they were convinced that I had missed the flight. Finally we took off at 7pm and were taken to Birmingham instead. After number of confusing instructions, both to stay on the plane and also disembark.Several passengers duty free items were confiscated as they were over the liquid limits when we went through Birmingham security. Since I had missed my connecting flight I was rebooked on the next flight the next morning and assured by Air India staff that I would be given airport hotel> But when I got to Mumbai, the ground staff denied that this could be a possibility. I ended up sitting up the whole night waiting for my next flight. There cannot be a worse man-made disaster of an airline! Keep away."

The connecting flight from London to Copenhagen SK 502 no food was booked or even informed, leaving the passenger for a surprise to pay their own snacks after such a long travel.

On calling the AI contact number there is no response for hours leaving the passenger helpless on the flight situation.

Due to incoming flight from VTZ to BOM (we missed international connection). Incoming flight has 2 hour connection time and VTZ fight delayed by 2:30 mins we missed international connection (6 Passengers in flight) but BOM to EWR flight started on time. This is when our terror started, now we were running around ticket counters to get rescheduled to next available flight, as airindia staff's standard response no other flights are available, we will rebook you for next day same flight and provide hotel stay. This happened after 4 hours waiting for ticket rescheduling with infant. Staff is not courteous or dont have any ethics. Next day 7/5/2019 BOM to EWR flight scheduled time is 1:30 AM, We reached airport around 11:00 PM(at this time flight status was showing on time). went to security check and gate, flight got delayed for 14 hours. We were sitting in the airport for 14 hours with toddler. (initial delay showed 8 hours, now they are incrementing it by 2 hours). We paid for extra leg room seats. When we get on flight we were told that those seats were assigned to another passenger and asked us to go talk to air hostess, also we found out this is not direct flight to EWR, getting stopped in Ahamadabad.

There are so many things wrong here, no proper customer service, even paid seats are not guaranteed. No information about flight getting routed to ahamadabad for passengers. No way of communicated anything to customers.I would never ever get on air india flight again. Customer service is pathetic. No care for small children and elders. How can they sell same seats to multiple passengers. Stupidity at peaks. Over all experience 0 stars and Air India Sucks big time. If you have a choice please take any other airline but Air India."

I reported seat broken & I was told that it was because I put too much pressure & therefore broke it.Never seen an airline blame their customer first, forces me on a cramped seat where I said that I will not participate in emergency procedures they didn't even tell me about, puts their employees in preferred seats while paid customers get run around.

They also let another person sit on my broken seat when I was told it was a safety risk.None of the excuses made sense.There was no system/rules, no safety procedures,no concern for customer satisfaction,no emergency evacuation instructions given or cared about

Done it in January'19 since then chasing them to close the claim but no response from their team. Always, same excuse Claim has been processed but is due to signed by Finance Manager. Same story for the past 5 months. Baggage Claim team Sravan Hyderabad and others they just fool you around and doubt they follow rules and abide by regulations.

Some Background Information:
We had a local connecting flight from Hyderabad to Mumbai (scheduled departure for 10 PM and scheduled arrival for 11:30 AM) and then we had an international flight from Mumbai to Newark ( scheduled departure 1:30 AM and scheduled arrival around 5 PM India time)
1. Very bad communication skills with customers- For our Mumbai to Newark flight that was already delayed by 12 hours (it was scheduled for July 2nd 1:30 AM). We finally arrived in Mumbai around 10 AM. While the flight attendees were going through the security check, the Air India staff informed us that our flight to Newark would leave at 2:30. And LISTENED TO US TALK ABOUT HOW RELIEVED WE WERE THAT WE WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SPEND AROUND 4 MORE HOURS WAITING FOR OUR FLIGHT. Later on, the Air India staff told us that our flight would actually be leaving at 2:30 AM not PM. Not only is our original flight being delayed by 25 hours, but Air India did not correct its customers when they were continuously feeling relieved over false information. THEY INFORMED US THAT THE FLIGHT WAS AT 2:30 AM WHICH IS AN EXTRA 12 HOURS!!! As an airline, it is their duty to be clear to the customer as to when the flight is leaving and being clear with that information especially when they are aware the the flight attendees are on a consensus different from the fact.
2. Horrible Service- In our first flight, from Hyderabad to Mumbai (left at 11:30 PM) , we flew all the way to Mumbai spent 1-2 hours in the air there and returned back to the Hyderabad airport at 3 AM because the flight had no place to land and apparently because of weather. Then, after we returned to the Hyderabad Airport, they kept us in the flight until 7:30 AM and at 7:30 AM we finally left for Mumbai and arrived at 9 AM. This means we stayed in an airplane for 6 hours when we should have only spent 1 and half hour in the plane for our flight. During this entire fiasco, the Air India staff only provided us with a biscuit packet with 2 biscuits and a lunch voucher that only worked during a horrible time. How is one lunch voucher and some biscuits suppose to last us for 17 and a half hours?"

The flight from Sri Lanka to India was good, except the fact that some of the request made were not understood by the steward. I traveled with three of my colleges, and we were offered tea and coffee. We asked on one cup of tea and two cups of coffee. Unfortunately we got two cups of tea and one cup of coffee. We had to point it out, and then we were given one more coffee.

The flight from India to Kathmandu was expected to take off one and half hours from the point we touched down in India. Unfortunately we had to sit and wait for another one and half hours before we had the chance of boarding the flight.

However, the disgusting fact of the flight from India to Kathmandu was not clean at all. I noted that there were used old plastic forks and spoons under the seats. In addition i dropped my flashlight guard and wanted to find it. Thus, my and my friends bent to look for it, and found remaining of food on the floor, and did not find what I dropped. I am not sad about my loss, but the National Carrier Representing India needs to be maintained with much more cleanliness than this.

The second point that I noticed, was when food was served, there was a shortage of food on the flight, which resulted in some who do not like vegetarian food having to opt out either to eat or stay in hunger. Whether someone flies economic class or business class, I guess the basics need to be their, and this is or prime importance Air India represent your country to the whole world."

Hostess rolled eyes behind a Mom who was struggling with a toddler. A bug bit me 😕. My entertainment system did not work while coming back, although even though it would have been up, it showed just a handful of movies from 2017 mostly. And oh yah, the touchscreen didn't like my touch. Bathrooms were un-equipped half the flight. I got a terrible stomach bug which is still there after 2 weeks! I also got some sort of viral which gave me bad congestion and lost my voice for days. I assumed it must have been from the hot weather in India, but the doctor suggested from the timing that it must be the flight.

Firstly, my window seat was changed to an isle seat saying there was some issue with my seat. I was made to stand at the door for 15 minutes blocking the passengers entry with no one to attend. Absolutely no cordination between staff members.

Upon reaching Mumbai, I collected my baggage and found the lock broken and an Unopened fitbit watch and a leather fitbit belt were missing from the same! I raised a complaint (staff was supportive enough in this case) but had to rush for my next flight soon.

On reaching Hyderabad, my baggage was lost adding to all my frustration and bad experiences. I raised a complaint again and I was promised that it would be sent in the next flight and delivered home on the same day. It has been two days with no news of my baggage so far. I tried calling them several times but each time I had to wait for more than 45 minutes to connect to speak to an agent only to understand that they do not have any information about baggage. Also, I was advised to call Mumbai airport to check for bag status (absolutely no coordination between the staff again). After requesting to escalate the issue, I was told they have placed an emergency call back with higher officials for which I have been waiting since hours!!!!

I have a trip planned to US in a week and all my necessary and expensive ( new items) things are lying in the bag. With my bitter experience of losing a fitbit in previous leg and the progress so far, I do not have much hope on the staff.

Has anyone faced a similar experience before? Any suggestions on this?

Thanks in advance

Oh yes, I would never choose this airlines again!!!!"

Boarding information and gates keep changing constantly without letting passengers know. After we boarded they told us flight itinerary has changed and flight will go through Mumbai. At Mumbai again we were on the plane for 5 hours before it took off for Dulles. And they offloaded all our Cargo due to weather conditions. It is unclear why they flew us to Mumbai when weather was bad in Mumbai. Delhi weather was good but they decided to go to mumbai without any clarification. Whwn we reached Dulles guess what none of passengers had their bags!! No bags were delivered. Today is Day 10 after my travel date and I still don't have 2 out of my 3 checked bags. When I call customer service no one picks up. Out of 20 times once it gets picked up. And they don't give any information where the bags are or when they will be delivered. They refuse to provide PIR Reference for the bag claim that I filled at airport so I cannot trace my own bags. There is absolutely no customer service. They treat you like less than human beings. There is no accountability!! It is unbelievable that this airline is still operating. It should be shut down!

Finally we took off...only being treated to poor in-flight service, very bad food, poor in-flight entertainment, not so clean aircraft. Ultimately we reached Delhi 2.5 hours late, without a word of apology from the flight crew and incorrect information about the baggage belt. I was lucky enough to catch my onwards flight from Delhi (literally had to make a run for it) however some other co-passengers from Air India flight were not that lucky!!!

1. Not updated website & lack of proper communication to customers: I booked these tickets since this was the shortest duration flight that was available on the day. After booking, two days before the flight, they sent an email stating that the flight will be rerouted via VIE (no other info was provided). I understand this change in route was unavoidable, but the communication to the customer was unclear and insufficient. I had to check separately how this would impact the flight duration & arrival time. (No info was provided on their website!!) This increased the flight duration by 5 hours, and I had to rebook their connection flight, in addition to booking hotel accommodation for the night (additional $1000 spent in the process) till the next feasible connection flight was available.

2. Unreliable service and not providing service for what you paid: I had paid extra for each seat so that everyone could get a comfortable seat ($35-50/seat). I wanted my grandmother to feel comfortable and also considering this is a long flight, wanted to seat all of them together so that they could talk, etc. The airline seated all five of them separately (none of them got the seat I had paid for), in spite of having paid extra money!!! They did not refund the money either.

3. Unresponsive customer service: In order to ask for refunds for the seats, I stayed on their line twice for at least 35 minutes for each call and there was no response.

I am very disappointed by their service would never use Air India for any international travel and will never recommend it to anyone!!!"

Here's what went wrong:
1. The self-check in had a glitch. It would show steps from entering the booking reference to printing the boarding pass, but as soon as I entered the reference, it would say something like ""Passenger identified"" and then exit.
2. At the departing airport, I was charged Rs. 525 per extra kg of baggage even though my ticket said 400. This could've been an error on the part of the site I booked with though (I did not book through the Air India site).
3. The staff (including the check-in staff) weren't even nearly as courteous as any other airline's in my experience.
4. The toilet on the ATR 72-600 I flew on was literally stinking and had a clogged drain in the washing sink. (That's a first for me)
5. The food on board was a veg roll and water. That sounded fine to me, but the roll itself was pretty mediocre.
6. After landing at BLR, the flight crew got into some argument with the ground staff (some verbal exchanges were audible to us passengers) regarding ground services and we had to wait in the aircraft for around 15 minutes after the doors were opened before deplaning."

However, AI Staff is okay as they exhibited politeness and care during the journey.
After boarding the connection flight, just before it takes off after rushing to the another terminal (after completing immigration, customs, baggage drop, security check).

When I landed at my final destination, the baggage never arrived & no staff is available to enquire. Due to many such customers with baggage ""missing"", finally managed to hold the point of contact, have been informed that baggage left in origin destination due to confusion.

Finally, managed to hold onto the team to track my baggage after 2 days.

Then the air craft becomes grounded & we are requested to deplane to board another aircraft. Further we are subjected to a security check a second time which also became a harassment as there was hardly any staff to speed up the unnecessary process. The small children had become very fussy by 3 am. Then we boarded the next flight running to the next opposite gate so that flight could now leave in a orderly fashion. But after 15 minutes an announcement was made that the pilots had to deplane because of some regulations. With just no further explanations about the current situation, there’s an announcement plz open gate l2. At 5 am with much confusion people started deplaning the aircraft a second time only to surround the two ground staff for some kind of explanation. It was really shameful to explain to the foreigners who didn’t understand hindi that its okay for the National Carrier Of India to behave in such fashion.

All of these looked quite battered really. Gathered later that most of the people I was flying in with flew seldom or for the first time. They were mostly the migrant workers, the blue-collars who throng the middle east in search of a better life.

It was an evening flight and was pretty full. You could see a thick cross-section of the socio-cultural strata all lined up looking for their seats in the wide bodied plane.

The crew initially appeared to me as a passive, although I could see a lady who was very courteous and extremely busy guiding some first time fliers on the left isle. I was seated on the right isle.

Accompanying a special guest, I was able to have a quick look at the first and the business class seating too, while on ground. Was spacious and opulent looking.

The economy was spacious than most I have flown in. The last very long flight I took from Abu Dhabi to Chicago was in Etihaad, which was tighter than this considering width of the seats and also the legroom. This one was really ample for economy.

The food was fair enough and the drinks ware good for a short flight.

The flight left a little late but arrived well before time at Dubai.

I had a nice experience overall.

The ticket for me from Indore to Dubai with a layover (I had work in Delhi which I finished comfortably between 11 am and 5 pm) was for 14k only, which got tripled when I took another airline back home in the absence of Air India flights.

Although I confirmed my trip before leaving the states, upon arrival in Delhi I was told I had no reservation and Air India had no flights to Hyderabad to accommodate me for days. The flight I was supposed to be on was overbooked by 20 people. Air India didn't even make any attempts to rebook me on another flight. This also happened to my co-worker who booked via a different company. We were able to get on the flight after having to pay someone additional money in the form of a 'tip' when they recognized that they had 4 people who were going to miss the flight.

On our return trip at Hyderabad we were given boarding passes by Air India all the way back to the states and our bags were checked to Denver at the international terminal. We showed our passports a couple of times. Our flight had a creeping delay that kept changing and left many hours later. We were advised by the gate agent that someone from Air India would be there in Delhi to help us make our connection to the Swiss Air flight to Zurich. There was no-one upon arrival in Delhi to assist us for a flight leaving in 20 minutes. Once we got to the fork where you can either exit to baggage or go thru the International gate area, we flagged down an Air India person with a radio. He asked for our boarding passes and advise that because the boarding pass stated 'D' we had to exist domestically and then re-enter the airport on the other side. My co-worker was not handed back her e-ticket/boarding pass and asked for it back. Air India had given it to someone else. We eventually found her ticket with the other person but by the time we re-entered, we had missed the connecting flight. Air India was unwilling to rebook us. We found on our own, another carrier who rebooked us at 3 am for a 3am flight the next day. This meant we were stranded in Delhi for 24 hours and would need a hotel voucher. The employee from the other carrier that rebooked us took us to the Air India counter and asked for a Travel Voucher which the Air India manager on staff denied. She stated Air India had no responsibility for us missing our flight due to their 3-hour delay and that airlines will not put people up for a missed connection. When I advised her that I had 23 years worth of experience in the industry she backed down and then sent us out of the airport on one side of the building and advised us to go to the opposite side to pick up our vouchers. When all said and done, it took 4 hours to get rebooked on our own and then fight for travel vouchers, then walk all over the terminal, waiting almost an hour for them to write the vouchers. Next time I go back to India I will avoid this carrier and I advise everyone else to do the same."

The breakfast served was really nice and filling. The flight didn't have an entertainment system as it was a short distance domestic flight.

The attendants where ok, we’ve enjoyed a lot better service on other airlines but air India was average in comparison. Seats weren’t very comfortable. A bit worn around the edges. Under my seat a strange puddle appeared during the flight. I found out when I dropped my blanket and it was wet through when I picked it up. No spares on the plane so a long cold flight for me. TV didn’t work on the outbound or return flight. Only offered one drink in the return journey and the food was so so, my partner couldn’t eat hers and we both love Indian food.
Couldn’t find an address to complain and had no response from the customer services email address.
It was a direct flight though so that was good. There had to be one redeeming feature!"

A variety of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages with snacks are served and a smaller meal served before touchdown. Cabin crew are courteous and service is decent. The flight is a direct one with no stopovers. Cabin temperature was maintained at a comfortable level throughout the flight. On board shopping does not exist.

Flight from Delhi was delayed 1 and 1/2 hours. Flew to Mumbai due to closed airspace over Pakistan. 5 hours delay in Mumbai. We sat in plane. It was announced that they need to take out some cargo and adjust. Right before landing in Washingon, they announced something like you might not have received some of your luggage. Sorry. None of the passengers received any luggage at the IAD airport. The Air India employees asked all passengers to fill out delayed baggage forms and kept taking the forms as filled. They told passengers 'your luggage would arrive in 1 or 2 days. The employees were dealing with a lot of people and helping them fill out forms. None of the passengers were given 'reference numbers'. Today is 15th June and they have not heard anything from anyone. Luggage has not arrived. No one is answering phones in Air India or replying to emails. My nephew called Delhi office and Air India needs the reference number, which we were not given. Very frustrated."

As the flight is about 10 hours we bought seats with extra leg space for the two flight. Each seat cost about 40 Euros per flight. When we got to the airport of New Delhi to fligh back the employee in the counter decided to change our seats to ""normal"" ones without even telling us and withy even mentioning that we could apply to a money return. when we mentioned the situation to the employee he didn't believe we payed for the seats and only after showing him the receipt he actually believed what we were saying and changed it back ( I don't understand how the system doesn't show how payed for what). The second part of the problem started when we arrived to gate and we had one again the same problem. They told us our chair was changed because some other person payed so we had to move. After talking to the employee and showing him we also payed he told is there was nothing he can do because both business class seats and with more leg space were taken.he finally told us or we accept the situation or we don't get in the plane. After the planes departure ( 20 minutes after the guy in gate gave us an ultimatum) I checked to see if there where seats available and they had 3 with extra leg space and in business. Finally in the plane we talked with one of the ladies from the plane and the only thing she gave us was a review paper (just to write how was the food bad other things) but I wasn't even able to write a complain about the situation. Finally the head of the flight attendants head of the situation and told me she was unaware of what was happening and that she would write a report down and that she would talked to someone to neat us at gate for our refund but of course this was useless ( she told me to look it up in the web page which of course is not very friendly).

I know there can be problems with in a system but was I can't believe is how the employees or AIR INDIA managed and lied throughout the situation. If they made a mistake that created a problem for a passenger they should be more understanding and try to help out. This airline was a dissapoitment in comparison with other star Alliance members that are more client focused."

The plane was old and seemed like it should have been taken out of service years ago, the personal entertainment system was like in all air India flights I’ve ever been on - broken. The food was rather questionable and the staff walked through the cabin at the start of the flight spraying very pungent air fresheners all over the plane. If you ever see a British airways flight or Lufthansa flight for 50 pounds or so more - just trust me that those 50 pounds will be well spent for not having to travel Indian airways."

11th June I flew AI0315 from Hong kong to Mumbai via Delhi in business class. Flight got delayed marginally due to which I missed indigo flight from Mumbai to Mangalore via Hyderabad.
This again made me choose pathetic AI 679 and the experience this time was terrible.
1) Although I did web check in, it took me over an hour to get my printed boarding pass, staffs at the baggage drop were so slow which reminded me of sloths coupled with a staff taking a break without anyone attending counter and even without notifying floor manager. Replacement only came in after one of the passenger started shouting.
2) Flight was supposed to fly at 10.25 am but no staff was at boarding gate 51 until 10.45 am.
3) People had already started queuing up for boarding due to delay and at last minute the staff started announcing sequenced boarding (20 and above), 15 and above etc and asking every one to follow single queue. This is perfect example of how you create mess and complain mess on others.
4) Anyone in Air India customer experience department listening?"
