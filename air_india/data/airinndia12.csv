The lighting in flight was very well. Boarding started on time and flight took off on right now. Airline staff was very polite and helpful and food served was hot and nice. Only issue I faced while the journey was, my entertainment system had some issue. And when you have to spend 16 hours in sky without sunlight, thats not a great thing to have. But luckily, seat next to me was free and I used that entertainment system. We landed in Newark (EWR) 20 mins before scheduled arrival time. Overall I had a great experience and I would sure fly Air India again, at least for this route"

I must say that the Air India ground staff at Delhi Airport is one of the rudest I have ever experienced. My parents had a separate flight to London exactly after an hour and they felt the same thing. The staff looked inexperienced and did not know how to speak to a customer. I have never seen any ground staff behaving so rude to any passenger. Even though they had all the details about my ESTA and flight itinerary, the ground staff made it miserable by asking me a paper confirmation. This was not the first time I was traveling to United States, but the way Air India at Delhi Airport operates, really makes me feel uncomfortable in choosing this airline again if I ever come to India. On the other hand, the ground staff at JFK was much polite and helpful. It is a shame"

Boarding was disorganized. The signs said that boarding would be by row, so I waited in my seat, as everyone else lined up. Then the gate staff proceeded to board people first-come, first-served. I think people would adhere to the boarding procedure if gate staff enforced it. That said, boarding was pretty quick.
Aircraft was a 787-800. Seat pitch was great - maybe the best I've seen in regular economy.. With 3-3-3 seating, the seats are narrow, but most 787 operators use this configuration. Rest rooms were clean at the start of the flight, and remained so. Dimmable windows and mood lighting on the 787 are great - not just a gimmick.
Ordered the vegetarian Indian meal. It was fine Flight attendants made four service passes through the cabin: beverage (wine was free), meal, coffee, snack.
In flight entertainment ok - large selection of mainly second tier movies.
There were a lot of young children on this flight - at times screaming and running up and down the aisle. Airline staff probably want to avoid getting into conflicts with parents over kids' behavior - I saw no attempts to quiet the cabin on this daytime flight.
The flight left on time, and arrived early at EWR - it took a long time for baggage to come out, but that's Newark's issue."

1. Unhygienic
- diarrhea after eating the food on the flight to India (but no issues in India itself! I didn't eat the food on the return flight, rather brought my own).
- the bathroom was BROKEN on Dec 20, 2017... and then (same plane on the way back) still BROKEN over 2 weeks later on my Jan 5 return flight. Disgusting... not enough bathrooms on the flight for all the passengers!

2. poor service
- flight attendants refused to serve me drinks, of any kind (e.g. a Coke) until AFTER I happened to volunteer my services to 2 ill passengers ( I have a medical background). Then they provided me with a drink.

3. plane in disrepair
- my seat was broken on each leg of the trip (and I had different seats): 1st wouldn't recline, 2nd had a broken foot rest

- the audio-visual was completely broken (again I had difference seats). total luck if you got a working screen in your seat...

Airport Air India staff, and staff in the planes themselves were not helpful and did not assist me in filing a formal complaint with the company (I was merely ignored).

In the Udaipur airport we were informed that due to weather (smog and smoke in Dehli), our flight was delayed. This makes sense and there is nothing the airline can do about it so no problems with the delay.

Because of the delay, we knew we were going to miss our connecting flight so tried to talk with someone at the airport to get help. There was only one representative from Air India and he told us that he could not help us and we would have to go to Delhi to figure things out.

After a nearly 5 hour delay, our flight took off and we made it to Delhi. Once in the airport, the real issues began. We had to go to three counters and talk to five airline representatives in order to get boarding passes for the next flight to Kochi (at 5 am the next morning). Once we finally had secured boarding passes, they told us we could get a hotel room for the night but they refused to reimburse us for our hotel room in Kochi that evening. When pushed, they sent us to a completely separate part of the airport to another Air India counter.

At this counter, we encountered 20 person lines and it took nearly an hour to speak with anyone about either our hotel that night or our hotel reimbursements. When we finally spoke with someone they couldn't help us with either thing and passed us off to two colleagues before finally we got to speak with a manager. The manager proceeded to tell us that not only would they not give us a hotel reimbursement, they would not give us a hotel for the night either. He said it was too late and there was no point in going to a hotel for 4-5 hours of sleep and suggested we just sleep in the airport. After we told him that that was unacceptable, he yelled at us and told us it was our fault.

It took us another 20-30 minutes to finally convince someone to get us a hotel room for the night - still not even a conversation about reimbursement for the hotel in Kochi. Because of all of the inefficiencies and incompetence, we got only a couple of hours of sleep which just added insult to injury in the whole process.

Thanks Air India for ruining nearly two days of our vacation!"

Legroom was pretty good, and seat comfort was good enough to go ahead and get some sleep on this flight. The entertainment selection was all right, though it was quite outdated. It had an episode of Shark Tank on there, from Season 6 if I recall correctly. Not a big deal, as it's at least something, and the selections you have to choose from are pretty good. They have Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Night at the Museum 2: Battle at the Smithsonian, Shrek, Dark Knight Rises, under Classic Movies - English, to name a few. TV has Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond, and Big Bang Theory, to name some under there. Music has all Bollywood soundtracks, as far as I am aware. So there's a good selection, in that regard. Food quality was at least decent, to say the least. Personally, I'm no fan of airline food, but the day after I came home, I read that sense of smell and taste are reduced at cruising altitude, so that's probably why. Service was good, though we did have someone needing a wheelchair and it was kinda slow to get it to the gate, but I can't blame them. After all, it does take time for it to get to the gate, with everyone filing out. In all, for a state carrier, it is a pretty good airliner, even with its flaws that cause people to dislike it. Though I must say, I can see why one of those flaws, cause people to dislike it: delays. It was delayed for quite some time. One flaw that really bugs me, is that when you are a transfer passenger, the gate is not printed on your boarding pass. These things make it hard to suggest, despite liking my experience with Air India, as a whole."

Domestically AirIndia has always been really good and except for one incident where the flight attendant told me if I wish to remain seated in the emergency seat I would need to listen to the instructions only in English not Hindi. Later AirIndia did write back apologies and say steps were being taken not to repeat this incident again. On takeoff from Delhi this time I was sitting in the second last row of the plane and as the plane titled upwards water from the air conditioning unit started pouring down on my head, so I try to wait but it was just to much so I moved to the back middle seats. Staff had stuff up the seats with all their own bags so I had to sit at the other side. I told the flight attendant who was seated at the back what was happening. Once the seat belt sign was off another male attendant started shouting at me that I was in staff seats and to go back to my seat immediately. Initially he refused to listen to my complaint. (On previous flights back from Sydney to Delhi flight attendants have told me they were partying all the time once here so need to sleep). So it became clear at this point that he could not care that my head was wet. Then another lady flight attendant came suggested I seat further up the plane. (Not once did any other them think to offer me a towel). Meanwhile all the other passengers just stared. Obviously no other passenger wanted to get involved given the bad press lately in India with airline passengers and airline staff. I thought well at least they have given me three seats, great. Little while later they sat another passenger in my row. He had paid upgrade on his free tickets (AirIndia still gives out free tickets to relatives) to Business Class. However at the last moment apparently the Captain wanted his wife to travel so he was downgraded and given the seat next to me. I have written several times to AirIndia and also written to their Nodal officer and just keep receiving computer generated acknowledgements. Hopefully they might read this write up and contact me. What worries me is that should there be an emergency on the flight we must look up to the flight attendants for help. Instead it appears the flight attendants at the back are far more interested in protecting their seats so they can get some sleep."

The flight time is of around 2 hours from push back to landing. The aircraft is an Airbus A320 and has meal service on board. This flight is run as a domestic leg of an international flight i.e. it originated from Dubai and then from New Delhi it goes to Bhubanaeshwar. This was not told earlier as it caused little inconvenience to us as we had to rush for boarding. Overall a good flight to Bhubaneshwar.

Pros:
1. Flight booking was done through the Air India website which was done without any glitch
2. Seating in Economy is good with plenty of legroom to stretch
3. Food was good, nothing fancy about it. We had requested for child's meal while booking so it was provided
4. Crew was courteous and helpful
5. Smooth takeoff and landing

Cons:
1. Though the flight was within India, but it was run as an International flight which required us to go through International departure at IGI airport. Since international departures are required to be at least 1 hour before we had to literally run for boarding the plane. This was not communicated to use before as we considered it as a normal domestic flight.
2. Interiors were little worn out and needed little bit of cleaning

The worst part was lack of communication from the staff who would not look you in the eye let alone be helpful. This behaviour recurred again this January.
My preferred airline's flights were cancelled from Chandigarh due to fog so I could not get the connection at Delhi. As a result I bought a new ticket with AI to fly out from Delhi that night. Once I got to Delhi I was advised that in spite of already having a seat number, I could not travel on this flight. This was also the case with many other London bound passengers. Reason? yes - overbooking plus people being put onto this flight from an earlier flight cancellation. This airline should not be selling tickets if they know they are overbooked or weather will affect how the seating plans are. Very unprofessional, immoral in selling tickets under false pretences culminating in no information being sent to the passenger. Total lack of care and compassion to the passengers dilemma as a result of airlines policies."

After my experience now I know why foreigners don't travel in Air India .. Even as an Indian I would never travel in Air India.
When I did reservation of this flight then I was told that this is a direct flight from New York to India with a halt of 1.5 hours at Mumbai Airport. Till the time we were in US boundaries we were treated well but once we reach Mumbai our all good experience was gone. My tickets were on an International flight from New York to Delhi with Non veg food to be served. Once we landed Mumbai then an announcement was done that all the passengers except the Delhi passengers can leave the flight as this flight was supposed to go till Delhi, then after few minutes they announced that all the passengers including Delhi passengers need to leave the plane as they will move us to another Air India plane and the reason for that was less Delhi passengers were left in the flight so to save money they shifted us to another Air India Domestic flight which was after 3.5 hours from Mumbai. We waited in Mumbai for almost 4 hours and then boarded Air India flight and I had to take my all luggage and did check-in again. In that flight when food was served then we were offered Vegetarian food and was told that in Domestic they don't offer Non-Veg even if we had International Flight tickets .. In short I can say that they downgraded my tickets and treated me like domestic customer and not only that, I also wasted extra 4 hours because Air India wanted to save some money by transferring us to another domestic small plane which was not ready to fly until next 3.5 hours ...
While waiting for domestic flight no one even offered us a glass of water and the food that was offered in the domestic plane was so bad that I can not even describe. So I decided not to eat that food .. No doubt why these domestic flight like Air India offer less price ..
Friends - Its better to spend some extra money and book some good flights and avoid flights like Air India .. These people have got the international flight license but they don't have International standards ...
Air India International Flights are the worst I have ever experienced .."

Then you save on food, with excellent lunch or dinner with totally Indian good quality food with jeera peas pulaw, sahi paneer, daal makhni, salad, lachha paratha, gulab jamun all fresh & hot courtesy AIRPORT RESTAURANT & FLIGHT KITCHEN AERODROME PATNA, which supplies real tasty food, even better than, what we get from Airindia Delhi originating flights.

Finally even in extreme fog, when arrival of aircraft gets delayed for 2 hours, it still compensates an hour with very professional quick boarding, speed flying and at destination gets late only by an hour, and even with less than 50 meter visibility in 2nd attempt, even doing a go around after being unable to land in first attempt, safely lands at 2nd runway. That is the professionalism, class quality and service of AirIndia.

I really felt so nice using AirIndia.

Only if politicians, bureaucrats, courts stop making Airindia loose on profit route and peak traffic times (which mostly given to private airlines, and asking Air india to take all burden of non profit flying time and routes, making air India loose revenue), Air India have potential to be THE BEST and even cheapest airlines with profit as well as best service.

Departing on Emirates I once counted 32 security steps, from entering the airport till boarding the 777-300 of Emirates.

BUT, this insane marriage of two sacurity-obsessed nations - Afghanistan and India - is nothing short of grotesque.

I'm an investigative journalist, a was correspondent, but even I saw nothing like this, anywhere.

Air India parked its Airbus-319 away from the gate. After those usual proverbial 32 Afghan security checks, passengers had to go down to tarmac and then identify their luggage (and believe me, it was not efficient at all). Then, at the bottom of the stairs there was an agent checking identity of passengers. And at the top of stairs, an Indian 'secret agent' doing the same.

Business class cabin was dirty. Food inedible.

Air India's Dreamliner (787-8) felt old, so old, although it couldn't be more that few years of age.

There are moments when I enjoy flying Air India. I'm an airline junkie. Perhaps bit masochistic, too. But this was really too much.

The flight reaches Stockholm around 17:45 from Delhi and starts back to Delhi with in 2 hrs, so the cleaning was not adequately done. One can really feel the stale air and the smelly toilets.

Inflight the meal choice was between a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian. The meal did the job although I don't think Air India should expect a Michelin Star any time soon. There was no alcohol served on this sector.
The cabin crew were sort of friendly and ""got the job done"". That was however about it. As soon as the meal tray was cleared the curtain was shut and the crew were hiding in the galley.

1. It would be a non-stop journey.
2. The check-in baggage allowance would 25kg per person.
3. It was very reasonably priced for us.
4. They would provide meals, and even offered special meals, perfect for my vegan husband.

The checking-in, security and boarding processes were good, and all done timeously. The flight was delightful. There was good leg room and seats were comfortable. Most of the passengers, including me, took advantage of the opportunity to have a midday nap.
But, unfortunately there was a downside. When the meal trolley came, and were offered a choice of veg or non-veg, we told the flight attendant that we would wait for our special meals. (We had flown several airlines in different countries (including domestic) and always got our special meals when requested.) We were told that veg and non-veg were the only options available, and we probably requested the special meal too late. This was shocking, as we booked the flight and made meal requests 5 days earlier, which was also reflected on the print out of the ticket. The veg meal that we were given, included paneer, and there was no way of knowing for sure if the rest of the food contained dairy products. My vegan husband was offered a Jain meal instead, but the flight attendant could not guarantee us that dairy was excluded, along with the root vegetables that a Jain meal does not contain.
No doubt, the veg meal which I accepted was delicious. But my husband was not convinced about his meal.
A customer expects to be given what is requested, ESPECIALLY when it is offered during the time of booking. Had we known that vegan meals were not to be provided during this lunch time flight, we would have been more than happy to have packed and carried some food with us.
AI should perhaps remove this option from their dietary requests on their website if they are not going to be able to provide them to customers with special dietary requirements.
Apart from that, I would still recommend AI."

Legroom was good, and seat comfort was all right. The food onboard was pretty good. I had rice and lentils, and I liked it. Just be aware that on domestic flights with Air India, it’s vegetarian only with the food. Service was good, though a little on the slow side. Overall, I had a good experience with this flight. I can probably suggest Air India, potentially."

Night before the departure, started receiving the message from Air line about the delay in departure. First message 0830, next message 0930 !!!!!
It actually departed at 1000 in the morning !!!!! I obviously missed by next flight and had to buy another ticket at 16k INR for Mumbai to Ahmedabad.
(BTW I approached Air India till Duty Manager but was refused to help straight away.)
Never book with Air India when you are having connection with different airline."

The food wasn't bad choice of India or continental. Seats were average pitch. Main issue was poor in flight entertainment. Few western movies and no western music. But plenty of indian movies. I would say that Emirates or Turkish are much better for international clientele but Air India is fine for locals going from uk to India and Australia.

We met some travellers who had luggage problems with other flights and had to pay for extra weight. It is very difficult for international travellers to travel by domestic flights if they are not aware of this. In flight service in Air India is excellent. The refreshments in domestic flights is quite nice. Another major plus point is that you can get Air India domestic flights from International airports so you don't have to run around changing airports."

The timing of the flight (Mumbai Departure 1100 Hrs) is very convenient.
The flight arrives in Jamnagar at 1210 Hrs and the return flight departs from Jamnagar by the same aircraft at 1250 Hrs arriving in Mumbai at 1355 Hrs.
I was happy to see Air India honouring Military Personnel/Veterans by asking them to board first.

Dislikes
1. Always and always late
2. The ticket counter is normally closed at the lucknow airport. I don't know how do they afford such a luxury.
3. I had to request for a wheel chair and I had no idea where to go, so I asked the airport security at the main gates, they were kind enough to arrange the chair from inside
3. The crew is never well informed about situations, we asked the crew since the flight is delayed we shall not check in and we will come back to the airport after 2 hours, his reply was "" kya pata counter close na ho jaye""
4. Hospitality, these guys are so rude that were literally forcing my mother to some how manage to walk or wait just so that she could get off the wheel chair"

And two of the plastic things inside it had broken badly. One cardboard box of digital piano also got torn badly. This is how they treat your expensive belongings as if they are playing with it or taking out their anger and doing it purposely. I will never ever book Air India again in my life. They recruit very cheap people who have no sense of handling customer luggage.

Business Class",Probably never flying Air India again,"This was my first time flying Air India and the service was terrible. I wish I could rate them negative.

I flew business class from Madrid to Mumbai via Delhi (layover) on September 19 (flights AI126 and AI863). The staff on board the business class cabin was helpful and most meals were good.

Breakfast however, was not well prepared. Headphones offered were of cheap quality. In-flight entertainment had tiny font and limited options. But worst of all was Air India's customer service in conveying information to me and handling my baggage.

This was the first time I was flying into Delhi from overseas. So, to be sure, I asked a gate agent at the check-in counter in Delhi Airport if I have to claim my checked-in baggage in Delhi and take it through customs myself. She clearly said no, and that I would only have to collect the bag directly in Mumbai. So, I went off to the Air India lounge to relax for a few hours. Later while I was boarding the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, the gate agent told me my bag hadn't cleared customs and wasn't loaded onto the flight I was boarding. I was naturally frustrated and told him and I was specifically instructed to not worry about clearing the bag of customs myself. He said he tried calling me to notify, which I didn't believe because I had not received any call on my cellphone. I asked him why did he not at least attempt to call the lounge so they could convey the information to me? He had no valid response to that. He assured me my bag would arrive in Bombay by the next flight. I was slightly relieved but still miffed at incorrect communication and the lack of communication by the baggage check-in agent and gate agent respectively.

After reaching Bombay, I filed a complaint with the Air India office and was assured that the bag would arrive that night. And for any questions, I could call their 24-hour helpline. However, when I called the helpline late in the night, there was no response. The 24-hour feature was a joke. The bag didn't arrive that night. It had my formals so I couldn't attend office the next day and I was forced to work from home. The day after I landed was just about making several calls and getting redirected to different departments with no success. I was given phone numbers that didn't exist, and the phone numbers that existed just kept ringing and no one responded. After much hassle, I finally received the bag late in the night, a full one and half days after I landed. By then, a lot of inconvenience had already been caused.

I'm probably never flying Air India again, especially because there are so many better options around. Air India's customer service seems to be like that of a typical Indian government office - they don't care about you and they will always find ways to not do their job. It doesn't even matter what class you fly, you won't be treated well.

Air India should probably know this is an international service business, and their usual domestic tactics of avoiding work or putting off work don't do them any good. Terrible reviews of their service are mounting from several customers, and I wouldn't be surprised if they are forced to cease their services altogether or their assets get sold off to another airline that understands business and humanity better."

For business travel or holidays, the Air India flight to Singapore from Mumbai (AI342/343) is the ultimate choice. The flight leaves from Mumbai at 2350 hours and reaches 0745 the next day. Also, while flying back to Mumbai, the flight from Singapore is at 1945 and reaches Mumbai at 2250 in the night.

The flight is on the Dreamliner and is usually on time, also, in case of a delay, the flight still reaches Changi Airport on time, and there were no delays on both the time that I flew Air India. On the way to Singapore, light snacks (Veg. Sandwiches or Chicken Sandwiches) are served. Since most of the flyers prefer to sleep, a second helping is always available, provided you are nice to the stewardess.

On the way back to Mumbai, proper dinner is served and the staff are helpful and courteous!

Overall, an excellent experience with Air India, and I thank the staff for the superb service and courtesy!"
