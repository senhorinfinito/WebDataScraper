The staff is generally accessible in their local office unlike other airlines if you wish to approach them for a reason . There are numerous reasons to high light .The carriers are out dated and the service needs to be revamped .

Business Class",Shockingly decent for international business class (LHR-DEL-SYD),"I was dreading this one way flight back to Sydney. I had only heard terrible things about Air India and I can't say the TripAdvisor reviews gave me much confidence. I have flown their new 787 in business class before and I was not that impressed. I had low expectations for this very long haul series of flights but found myself overall surprised and impressed.

I had low expectations from the time I purchased the ticket. The Air India call centre staff could NOT give me a straight answer if I needed a transit visa for Delhi (it was only 2.5 hours transit). Not very helpful at all. You would think if they are trying to promote connecting traffic via Delhi they could at least advise if one was needed just to transit air side. In the end, I had assurances from the High Commission that one was not needed. I still didn't hold my breath but in the end none was needed for British or Canadian citizens and we didn't even pass any passport control during transit.

Trip started off at London Heathrow at T4. Check-in was nice and easy. I skipped the Maharaja lounge because it didn't have a shower and instead used another card to get into the Gulfair lounge. Please get a shower!

Flight was packed on the 787 which has a much better business class than the old 777-200 that they also operate. The plane was probably less than a year old but it felt neglected and poorly maintained on the inside. Colour scheme is pretty terrible as well. The seats were worn but at least in a decent 2-2-2 configuration and fully flat.

Flight attendants were surprisingly friendly and relatively proactive. We actually pushed back 15 minutes ahead of time which is uncommon for Heathrow. Pilots gave informative announcements and instilled confidence. Meal service was a bit slow but friendly and Indian main course was very tasty with quite a few options, including one western and Indian veg and non veg.

Inflight entertainment was decent including a variety of Western tv programmes. Lavatories were kept clean. I was really impressed with the inflight pajamas and the quality of the duvet that is given out. Really nice touches. There was no amenity kit on the LHR-DEL but instead just slippers and eyeshades - all you really need.

Transit in Delhi was good. Security queue was a bit long but can't fault the airline and they were expediting those with short connections. Lounge in Delhi is nothing special at all but the hot food was tasty once it was replenished.

DEL-SYD flight had a light load of only 6 pax out of 18 seats in Business. Nonetheless, the crew compliment in business maintained at 3 and were mostly senior crew members, kind of like Indian aunties. They were quite hospitable and surprisingly used my name quite a few times. They were quite attentive and made the flight enjoyable. I gave them positive feedback at the end of the flight and told them how low my expectations were. They were very appreciative.

Cabin temperature was kept comfortable; toilets were clean; food was quite good - biryani was the meal before landing and it was amazing. Seat was the same and is very comfortable. An amenity kit was provided at the end of the flight, almost as a departing gift rather than goods to use during the flight. It was kind of cute and looked quite 'home made'.

The business class is by no means leading edge or world class but it was comfortable and cheap. The connection to Sydney is actually pretty good and an unknown but good connection to get Down Under. I may have gotten lucky on these two flights with good service but in all cases, the hard product is good in business class on the 787.

I would fly them again for the same route, class and aircraft type. Why not give it a try?"

Delays due to myriad problems were typical of my travel experience. I recommend heeding the check in times as they are important. I would constantly struggle to get to the flights on time.

I used International Airlines for domestic travel as we had a lot of luggage (as we travelled to India from abroad for a few weeks family visit).

Now, when I was served tea on board, I found a cockroach in tea. I immediately called back crew member who was just a few seats away serving other passengers. She said, it wasn't there when I served. I smiled and said, I didn't bring it along. Then she wanted to take it away. I said, that it was safer with me. I put it in a plastic bag in which they provide cutlery, and kept it with me. Then the crew member went and came back with 2 other crew members, they tried to take it away from me. But, I wanted to keep the proof with me. I asked for a complaint form. And reluctantly they provided me with one. Now, this complaint form, when closed can easily be read from two open sides by anyone. I was meant to hand it over to the crew member.

When I asked the crew member for her name, no crew members wanted to reveal their name.

Anyway, I have never heard from Air India about this incident. I think the process is well defined and my complaint form would have gone straight into the nearest bin.

Economy",A piece of luck to fly with Air India,"We found ourselves flying with Air India unintentionally. We had been booked onto the British Airways flight to New Delhi from Heathrow on the second leg of our trip. 'Unfortunately' the first flight was delayed and our transfer was going to be missed so, credit to them, while we were still en route to Heathrow British Airways booked us on to the next available flight which happened to be with Air India.

To start with things didn't go so well. We arrived at the check in desk in an otherwise deserted part of the terminal to find no-one at their desk. Representatives of a couple of other airlines couldn't help until one of them made a telephone call and whoever he spoke to suggested he send us down to the boarding gate to see if someone there could help. So far things were far from promising and then we encountered the first member of Air India's staff. We had to wait a few minutes while he left to deal with another matter but he returned as promised and wrote out two boarding cards by hand. All of the window seats had sadly been booked so this gentleman placed me and my wife together in the front row with extra legroom. Quickly and satisfactorily dealt with in a vary efficient and courteous way.

Once on the place the person who had the window seat was given a free upgrade to business class and so I had my window seat. What made the flight so pleasant though was the quality of service in the air. The cabin crew seemed to keep an eye on people and in our case seemed to be able to anticipate when we wanted something. They were friendly and the senior member of the crew spent some time chatting with us in a quiet moment and mentioned that he had been to many of the areas in India that we intended travelling to. He said that when he had chance he would write down some hints and tips and suggestions about places to visit in each one and sure enough a while later he returned with several handwritten sheets with useful information on them.

Our flight was comfortable, on time and the staff were among the friendliest and most attentive we've encountered. The service could no have been improved. This was our first flight with Air India and if it's at all typical of the service they provide then this is an airline we would hope to fly with in the future"

Transit at Delhi airport is a nightmare (Air India flights are at international airport). There are no signs on display to guide transit passengers. The security check at Delhi airport can be lengthy and frustrating (leave adequate time for transfer~2hrs).
Avoid this airport if possible as a transit passenger.

Loos aren't clean either. Halfway through the second leg of my journey my seat stopped reclining all the way to a flat bed.

It is roughly a 2 hour flight and if you want to travel to the Andamans both in style and convenience then this is the best way to do it. The only drawback would be that you have to get up very early in the morning to catch this flight and customer service is not very good, however on the plus side this airline is the only one that is stable financially and the flight to these tropical island paradise are well worth it. My parents are elderly and required special assistance. Although the airline were quick to be aware of this and were generous to let me go with them. The way they were treated were terrible as the windows on the mobile truck and ramp were wide open letting the plane fumes and cold air in. We kept telling the porters of our problems, even in their own language but they keep saying 'OK' 'OK' and did nothing. We were probably better off just trying to walk like all the other passengers who are warm and safe and I was so worried that my mother and father would get very sick. My past experience with Air India especially when travelling from England was not very good and it appears that very little has changed and it is all the same even on the domestic routes. Apart from that poor start, the flight went well without any more drama and the view of the lush green islands and the beautiful blue sea from above is spectacular. For once I can thank Air India for a safe and pleasant flight to the Andamans and back. Just hope that its services both domestic and international improve rapidly over time. If flying on this specific flight, just buy the plane fare and don't bother on getting anything else as you may be worst of or you may not be able to get it on the day, including short flights such as this one. The most important advice is that you get the flight tickets and seats from a reliable agency, in my case Southall Travel, because they are much better and always check with the airline to confirm before you arrive at the airport and fly just to be safe."

Previous experience of Indigo and Go Air are to be kept behind. Gone are the old days of Air India, and they seem to be in a revival mode. Overall good service, good food, excellent leg space compared to other domestic carriers (this is something or utmost priority). Even normal seat (not ones near emergency exit) had good leg space, so whole time of flight was relaxed and with comfort. They don't charge extra for seat allocations even days before the actual flight date, while other like Indigo and Go Air charge.
The only cons which could be worked on are, customer service responses to email, no seat map view online to pre-book seats, call centre agents need to work better to cater to customer requests."

Dubai by 8.30 flight on same day. But it was shocking to note that OK TO BOARD has to be obtained at least 24 hours from DUBAI only and incase it falls on Friday then one can not get the same. How ever after great hassles I spoke to Director Commercial he was helpful to get OTB at 4PM ITSELF ON SAME DAY. But no corrective action has been taken yet. Even other carrier like EMIRATES , JET AIRWAYS had done away this or even other airlines offer this ON LINE. Most surprisingly the no of passengers in Business Class was 6 only."

The flight was full in my in bound flight on the previous day but the cabin crew really took care of all of us in the economy class. The breakfast served was excellent. So I expected a pleasant flight back to Delhi. However to my astonishment my ticket was upgraded to Business Class at the boarding gate. I have travelled in business class across the world but the service and the food served in this flight was five star.However there was no in-flight entertainment on the flight. Thanks Air India

Congrats! for that. But a few things could really make it more worthy of being in such an alliance. Its a fact that during monsoon and that too on MAA-IXZ sector the flight expereience is always not so good but still those are some natural conditions that can't be chased off but a few things that is related to the in flight service could be improvised please like legroom and customer service. The flight attendents and hostesses can be a bit more polite and humble rather than being always strict enough to shout at passengers. The strict policy of no photography on board and off board is not followed. The Inflght magazines are not updated and are often found torn. Infact, public is responsible for this but they should have a check on these. In the same whether and topography the other flights maintain their best routine flights then why can't Air India. Overall hospitality is good and the inflight announcements are not much informative. As a previllege member of the Frequent Flyer programme of Air India, Iam not yet satisfied by the sector service between MAA-IXZ and aback, whereas on the other sectors the service is quite appreciable. Last but not the least, the airport announcements are not so good for this sector as i see for other sectors its really announced for a couple of times but for this sector its just twice or thrice and too in a language and tone that is either not audible or understood. I hope the next flight will force me to write better. All the best Air India. My pleasure to fly with you again soon."

I called the agent to say that I will be travelling with my wife and my 4 month old baby so is a bassinet seat available for me and my partner to sit together if I book the tickets. The agent said..Yes sir and there will be no extra charges.

Two days later when i call Air india again it takes me to their mumbai call centre and the lady called Madhuri who admitted that the agent had made a mistake accepted the mistake but would not rectify the error. There will be a £30 charge for the adjacent seat each way. I did say my wife is not well and finds it difficult to walk hence i called first before i mage the booking. Frustrated I asked for her supervisor (Verlain) who was exactly the same with no empathy towards the customer but kept apologising. when i asked for a manager i was told i will get a call but no one did.

This morning, I call again and it goes through their Chennai call centre which was more horrendous to say the least. Spoke to a guy called Dinesh who was very incompetent passed onto his manager Satya who said he will call me in 2 hours but never received the call and after 4 hours I call back again frustrated to know what is happening and this time they can't transfer me as the call went to Mumbai.

What is most frustrating is that throughout the process they keep saying like a robot.. I am sorry sir, we apologise for the inconvenience sir, we cannot do anything sir, this is a chargeable seat and we cannot wave off. we understand we made a mistake but cannot rectify that. Finally, frustrated I managed to get a seat closeby. The team lacks empowerment, energy and leadership skills.

Really pleased to say this will be my last flight with Air India.. Well done Air India.. you truly make India proud...

P.S - Ashwani Lohani (CEO) - You keep saying Air India is a great brand which 90% of your reviews on facebook and tripadvisor dont agree to. Maybe its time you step down and have someone else take Air India to its next level."

When I checked in, I got my boarding pass for another window seat (way back in the bus, as opposed to the first 3 rows that I had blocked).I was told the the window seat I booked was now not available and the web site data is on a BEST EFFORT AVAILABILITY basis. Pertinent to add that the aircraft was the same configuration and nothing had changed. To add salt to injury, at the gate they changed my seat again to a middle seat. A flimsy explanation was given that since a family was travelling together, they allotted my seat to them. They were not willing to listen initially. It took a lot of effort and almost threatening them that I will get off the flight, that they again gave me yet another window at the back. The entire experience reeks of the callous attitude the airline has fostered with its employees...who just don't care. either they dont understand the concept of BLOCKING a seat and its importance. Sufficient to say this experience will ensure I dont travel them ever again...even if its a free ticket. Pains me to say this since I am an Indian and this is our national carrier. Everything else is secondary if you start a long journey being treated like that. Adieu Air India. Never again."

Mine was a morning flight and the breakfast they served was delicious and quite full.
In veg they offered parantha + paneer sabzi+ chane and some bread , fruits .

In non veg I think it was some sausage + omellete.. My co-passenger enjoyed that meal .

I asked one of the staff about a coffee at the pantry area but forgot to tell my seat number . The guy travelled the complete economy class to search for me with a coffee in his hand .. And very politely handed over the coffee to me and I felt sorry and gave him a big thanks .

The various choices available and some unhappy experiences on some occasions did force me to choose the other Air lines, especially in International Travels. But all said and done I feel more comfortable and at home when I am abroad an Air India aircraft.
The trip I had from Trivandrum to Delhi justified my preference to this carrier, especially because of the convenient timing, the almost fail-safe schedule( not once has their schedules been cancelled, except from very remote and isolated stations involving inclement weather), the predictable yet, comfortable checking in and inflight formalities. The booking was done through my travel agent and hence was done without any hassle. But the check-in formalities were as smooth as they could be. The counter service, was indeed courteous and fast. The boarding was also on time,non-cluttered and comfortable. Right from the warm ""Namaste"" as you enter the air craft, to the pre-take off and in-flight service makes one comfortable. The much touted complaint about very senior and disinterested in-flight crew is certainly not true. I would say the service of the experienced crew always makes one comfortable, though it may not be over-friendly.
One thing to be mentioned is the homely yet good meals served in the flight.
The baggage clearance did take a bit more than usual and made one a bit uncomfortable.
But y next trip to Delhi will also be with the ex-Maharaja."

We nearly missed our Air India flight to Kathmandu, Nepal because of the extreme disorganization of the New Delhi airport, which we had to connect through to get to Nepal from Colombo, Sri Lanka. We were separated from a family member in the process of going through the New Delhi Airport's gender-segregated security lines and the Air India staff tried to order us to get on the plane without him. We declined and asked them to make an announcement on the loudspeakers to call him to the gate, as we couldn't find him. (The plane was about to leave.) They took their time, refusing to make an announcement over the speakers until it was nearly too late. We almost didn't make the flight because of their unhelpfulness. To add insult to injury, they were extremely rude and suggested that it was our fault that we had become separated in the process of using their own airport's disorganized, gender-segregated security lines. When I politely suggested to an airline staffer that New Delhi Airport's disorganization was the real root of the problem, she very rudely told me, ""You stop talking now"" and basically told me to get on the plane. I was shocked. Air India is the government-owned airline, and clearly does not have the efficiency and customer service of a private airline. In contrast, we had a great experience when we later took a Jet Airways flight from Kathmandu back to New Delhi."

I arrived early at check in knowing that these things take time, so I was one of the first to get checked in (although we had tried to pre-book the seats, not very successfully it turns out).

The check -in man was courteous but a little clueless when it came to my ESTA and UK passport and that in itself took about 20 minutes to get sorted (there was not problem just his lack of understanding). I also checked about my seat, I specifically stated that I did not want the middle seat or the middle bank and definitely not near a child, since it was a long flight, I was repeatedly assured that it was aisle and not near a child... so far so good.

All was well until they called the flight and then the scrum began... there was not enough space for people to wait, it was late at night and no body seemed to know what was going on!!! Anyway on the flight we got... and yup.. you've guessed it; middle bank, aisle seat and the baby was actually asleep in my seat... not happy to say the least...

Luckily the flight was not full and so I managed to find myself a seat by the window and the next seat was empty!!! Yay... of course in spite of having informed them, the attendants were quite sniffy at not being able to find my seat to give me my special meal (non veg and not spicy - which I have to say was not bad at all... not great but not bad)...

All in all the flight was okay and I managed to sleep - though snacks were in the galley, getting a glass of water was not easy - apparently the attendants don't have to remember that you had asked for one... in that way, AI still have a lot of attitude.

Arrival etc. was fine though by the time one had got through Newark immigration, the belt had stopped, the bags were stuck there and there was no one to help the less-abled passengers with their bags... but that as they say is another story!"

Synonymous with air travel in India, Air India is the oldest and one of the largest airline service operators. It commenced operations in 1932 and is now part of the government-owned National Aviation Company of India Limited. It has received several ranking and continues to work at it.

What makes Air India my choice operator is that for the past two years they have been part of the Star Alliance so I can accrue miles and other benefits like making use of their lounges, etc.

One normally has a choice of meals, either veg or non veg and they still serve meals with silver cutlery, something many airlines don't do anymore. The meals itself is generally good.

Staff is helpful and always have a smile and that is from ground staff to the cabin crew. What was interesting was that Air India had their own security checkpoint prior to boarding the flight - but with the increased dangers, that is possibly a necessity."

No issues there, since you just walk across to the 'D' desk of immigration / passport control, show you boarding pass & ticket and board the aircraft.

I would say over all the flights I have taken, they have some bad days too, but so do all other airlines. But there is a mindset that just because it is government controlled they are totally inefficient. They have some of the best pilots, I mean i have had some hairy and bumpy landings with other airlines, but never with Air India. They have Taj catering so their food is pretty good, and some of their crew, especially the older staff can be really nice and genuinely know their job as opposed to some of the younger clueless staff I have seen on the other airlines. PLus now that they are part of the Star Alliance, i get points on my Lufthansa card which really helps, plus they are th eonly airline that still gives 25 kgs luggage allowance for Domestic travel too. Personally i think their rate of failure is as bad as any other airline, of course are they at the level of service a SIngapore Airlines, or even AUstrian Airlines (which I think are 2 of the best airlines we have) ...maybe not. But they are definitely comparable to the others like a Jet Airways, or even a Lufthansa & British Airways which can sometimes have really rude staff, especially with Indians.

Today, when I compare my travel with other Airlines, in India and Overseas, I do not feel that pride for our National Carrier. The difference between Private and Public is pretty obvious, in dealing and especially, when in crisis, the attitude seems to be very very poor.

Economy",good and bad as one sees it,"All said and done, it was the only option, which is due to one of its good points.
they take 25 kilos of luggage per passenger as against 15 of others. As I was on my way to the U.S, this WAS an advantage. the other plus was its departure time which was convenient for me. The check in was smooth. One major problem is the time but being the flagship carrier of the country, they have the right to Indian punctuality.They serve food, which is a plus point depending on the quality of food, which IS variable. One funny thing is they sometimes have male airhostesses ,and not so funny, aunties who are sometimes uppity up.."

But, food is very good, and in-flight service is very good.

However, back office customer service is virtually non-existent. I flew the Birmingham UK to Delhi and return route 8 times and receives frequent flyer (same as United Airlines) mileage for only one flight. I complained and complained, a few times in person at the ticket desk, all to no avail. I was always told the problem would be handled -- but nothing ever happened.

The attendants seemed to disappear at other times but that could be to allow passengers to sleep or watch movies but it would be nice to see them once in awhile should you have a need or request. The restrooms remained serviceable which was also a pleasant surprise. All in all not a bad experience."

Business Class",Pleasant and restful long haul,"My trip was in May-June 2015, for some reason I couldn't get the drop down menu to offer more than a year's options. But as the flight was so worthy of a review, with this new ability on Trip Advisor to review flights, I felt my experience could not be ignored.

The business class flight was reasonably priced from London to Sydney, from start to finish I could not have been happier. The lounge at Heathrow had comfortable seating, a good range of free drinks and food, as well as a decent range of both British and Indian reading matter. There was a short 3 hour stopover at Delhi, just enough time to freshen up and have something to eat or drink before heading on to Sydney. There is plenty of legroom! Heathrow to Delhi I think we had a 777-300 which was extremely comfortable in itself, but from Delhi to Sydney we had a Dreamliner and I just LOVED it. I was asked very politely whether I would mind moving seats to accommodate a family together, which of course I did not. And in fact I ended up with an even better seat than my original one :) - All the food and drink was very well executed and delicious.

The return journey included a 13 hour stop over which ordinarily would be rather an ordeal. But the flight includes a room and a meal in the hotel upstairs in Delhi airport so you remain ""in transit"" the whole time. The airline emailed me to remind me that the hotel room had been booked, and I just had to collect a pre-arranged envelope with my booking details when I got to Delhi. The hotel is easy to access, straight upstairs from the customs check, a quick shower and into bed. Perfect. The flight back to London was very enjoyable, with charming cabin staff who encouraged me (as if I needed it) into another pre-dinner gin and tonic, and upon request specially saved me an Indian dessert (to be fair, they seemed somewhat surprised but were happy to comply with a non-Indian showing such appreciation of their cuisine).

The in-flight entertainment includes both English speaking and Indian (Bollywood) film and television programmes, and there was plenty to choose from, so I wasn't bored. The seats also had USB charging points for my phone and Kindle, and there was plenty of legroom and comfortable gold cushions and light blankets.

I wasn't aware that as a business class passenger my baggage gets tagged for special collection and collected off the carousel - what a lovely surprise, so I wasted a few minutes at the baggage carousel, (used to that, though!) - but once I realised what was happening, I was more than delighted that someone had taken it off the carousel and had it ready and waiting for me. Lovely! An absolute pleasure to travel Air India,and I would recommend its business class to anybody."

Business Class","Awful experience, but long haul business class seats comfortable","First of all, we flew Hong Kong to Delhi, and then Delhi to Bangalore on Business Class. The crew at check-in at HKG wasn't particularly friendly, and a tour guide with a pile of over 20 passports (they all flew Economy) was using the Business Class counter when we arrived, however we checked in soon enough. We were given free lounge passes to the Plaza Premium lounge, which had a really wide selection of great, high quality foods especially in the Biz class area.

However during boarding, we had quite a few Economy passengers in our line (don't know why), and we had to take all water out (we had many bottles of water for our India trip), which was really frustrating. The cabin, however, was great, and the long haul business class seats are really comfortable. Good legroom on the 787 and the ottoman works well, however for sleeping in it didn't necessarily work well because my legs kept on banging on the walls/armrests and I the lie-down length was a bit tight (I'm 5""8), so had to lie down slanted. The food service was good with tasty food, however all the food was served on one tray. Moreover, for the 6 hour flight to Delhi we were only provided with a paper enveloped amenity kit which had an eye mask and socks which broke in no time. The entertainment was largely Indian, and the only foreign movies were pretty much Grease and some others from the 1970s and 1980s (I don't know why they have movies from such a long time ago). I ended up watching a Punjabi film called ""Proud to be a Sikh"", which was pretty boring.

However the seat reclined with the leg rest up was really comfortable and overall I thought the seat was superior to many business class seats I've been on. We had an overnight layover and we could only check in 3 hours before departure for the next flight (Intl-Domestic), so we had to sit 6 hours in the terminal. We visited the lounge and during midnight there was only plain bread, nuts and chilled drinks. In the morning, breakfast was available and I got some rubber-like egg, bread and tomatoes - small choice. The flight to Bangalore was on a domestic A321 and the seats weren't too comfortable. The breakfast was a bit of a disaster, all tasted bad. The cabin crew also didn't seem professional.

We flew Economy on the return trip, and I would say I'd rather walk from India to Hong Kong instead of flying Air India. Awful experience. Even though we used the Plaza Premium lounges in Bangalore, arrival and departure lounges in Delhi, the return experience was so stressful that I got to HK sick. The flight from BLR-DEL was on a A321 again with dated economy seats that look like they are from the 1970s and should be preserved in an aviation history museum. The legroom was just terrible, and the food was even worse I ended up not touching any of it. Delhi airport is a disgrace to India and the left luggage counter was really hard to find, with no one being able to speak English well.

We spent a day out in Delhi and returned to the airport early, however we couldn't enter the terminal because we can only enter 3 hours before our flight. I was already pretty sick at that point, and we waited in the airport's waiting room. When we entered, we waited nearly an hour in the check in queue to check in for HKG. Used the Delhi airport Plaza premium lounge which had food that smelt like it had gone bad. The 787's economy seat is pretty comfortable (even in a 3-3-3 config) and I liked the recline, however again the cabin crew were rude, the food was disgusting that I didn't touch any of it again. Slept well for the 4 hour flight. However the cabin smelt really bad (of sweat?) and rubbish was scattered all over the floor in the economy cabin. Absolutely disgusting.

I will never fly Air India again (even though they are really cheap compared to other airlines) after having such a traumatic experience with them."

Food is ok, but whilst flying on the above mentioned flight actually found a piece of crockery in my meal. I have no idea how it ended up in my on-flight meal, and thankfully I didn't bite too hard into the piece of food otherwise I would have cracked a tooth.

First off, the new delhi airport was awful!! Security was crazy to the point of my fiancé could not walk me into the airport and you needed proof of your ticket with your id for a flight that day to get in. I was patted down 3 times and my bags were checked 4 times inside the airport and one of those times included the Indian version of the American main ""TSA"" point (that time I totally understand and agreed to the security measures but 2/3 more times after that...little excessive!). But the worst part of the whole experience I had with air India was their racist and prejudice flight attendants and their snobby attitudes during my flight. They picked me out (the only white person, who is a middle class 20 something year old flying by herself just to make a point). I got yelled at for having my tiny back pack under the seat in front of me. Then I asked about the other 6 passengers around me who had their packs under their seats and she told me she will ask them to move their packs and she NEVER did. And their attitude about my meal preference change due to the fact I hate Indian food and was trying to find something I actually like. And that switch was having a switched from vegetarian for breakfast then to chicken for lunch you think I was demanding a 10 course meal. I officially will NEVER EVER fly with them again and will recommend everyone else to stay clear!!!! It is not worth it! And the customer service did not care about my complaint and never wrote back.

You will likely only get it during a meal or snack time. Rest all the time, you can keep on pressing the 'call the staff' button to no avail. The staff would rather rest in their cabins. God forbid if something happens in Air India, I doubt the staff will get up even in case of an emergency.

They helped me in securing the bag too, though I had forgotten mine at home, and they were out of inventory, still they managed, which was great. Plus, they did no nagging for baggage weight also, which used to be one of their major concerns.

The aircraft carrier was nice and smelt fresh. The staff was very pleasant, polite and friendly. The food quality was quite good, with the service being above average. I have had very bad experiences with Lufthansa and Air india at times, but this one was just like a fresh startover.

The lack of professionalism starts from their unrealistic timings printed on the boarding pass- The time for boarding to start is atleast 20 min later to what is printed. The boarding is not done seat wise , even if the staff make feeble attempts, the passengers do not budge and just queue up.
Passengers are allowed to carry more than one item as cabin luggage and then flight crew are struggling to stow away the excess luggage.
The flight entertainment doesnt work. The flight gets delayed on the tarmac itself for 30 min, we are all seated , no water offered.
Food served is average and unimaginative- chicken stuffed patties and buttermilk carton."

One cannot afford to have high expectation levels here because the price is more than half compared to the S.E.Asian airlines ! The aircraft was a Dreamliner, so seat comfort was pretty much the same as on other airlines. Don't expect gourmet food in economy class but it is palatable. Many give Air India a lot of flak, but for the price I don't think it is right to pass negative comments. No one goes out of their way or bends backwards but the service is good.

From the poorly designed and dysfunctional website, inefficient and slow check-in experience to poor onboarding process and a disappointing inflight experience, it is a sham all the way through.

I have faced instances where the departure time for an early morning flight was changed without any notification to myself (no SMS, no email, no call). I have faced instances where I have been sitting at the airport flight depareture gate, waiting for the delayed plane to arrive and upon calling Air India customer care have got responses that the flight was on time - their systems are apparently just not connected, or don't work.

The inflight staff seems so hassled themselves that I do not expect anything from them. While this is not always the case, it is most of the times.

For an airline that has been bleeding losses, at the cost of the nation's taxpayers, anything less than an impeccable service should be totally and unanimously rejected by the consumers.

The only saving grace is that Air India flies to/from Delhi's T-3 - a terminal that is indeed one of the best, so if your Air India flight is delayed, you atleast have a vibrant airport terminal to look up to. Also, since they fly several international routes, they have airplanes that are bigger than many of the other budget airlines of the country and hence offer better seats, better legroom and better overall flight comfort.

My message and request to all flyers, demand more and nothing less than perfection for your money. It's only professional, isn't it."

When we reached the air port there was practically no life there, the entrance was locked from inside although the reporting time had started. We got down from the vehicle after checking that we were at the right place and knocked at the gate.
Promptly a security guard allowed us in after checking our ticket. Surprisingly the check-in window was open. I got the seats I wanted, this was quite comfortable.

Punctuality: The flight was on time throughout.
Ground and on-board service: Air India's service is not as great as other airlines but they are trying to catch up, something that was quite evident from their behaviour. On the flip side, we did not get any help or advice from the air hostesses when we asked them about how to hold our child or if we need to do anything special. The service on the plane sadly was not great at all.
In-flight Entertainment system: Missing since this was a domestic flight.
Cleanliness: The aircraft was clean and had a nice odor.
Food: Air India have been known for their food, but I believe that is only applicable to metro cities. The food on the flight was strictly decent, not great at all.

This was the first time I was travelling in an Air India flight that too in a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner from Kolkata to Delhi. But alas my first flight with AI started with a 45 mins delay as the aircraft arrived late from Delhi. Check in was smooth. Boarding was quick as I had my 2 year old baby with me so got preference of separate and early boarding. Dreamliner is a new aircraft from Boeing with a 3-3-3 seating formation in Economy class. Seats are good and comfortable with ample leg room. In-flight entertainment system had all new Hollywood and Bollywood releases along with regional options. We were served snacks which was as expected not so good. Even Rajdhanis and Shatabdi's serves better options. Travelling in monsoon in India is really scary as there are lot of air turbulence but the Dreamliner handled it quite easily with no major incidents. De-boarding was also good and luggage was also on time. Overall a good experience considering a new aircraft but better avoid Air India."

I had booked the 5:00 PM flight from Mumbai to Delhi for 1st August 2016. On 31st July I received an SMS from the airline that my flight had been pushed to 6:00 PM followed by a call from them. When I asked for the ticket to be cancelled or rescheduled for the next day, I was informed that I would have to pay INR 2000 the fact that it was they who had forced me to reschedule my itinerary but the guy refuse to reschedule my flight.

As a last ditch attempt I gave a call to their customer care to clarify but the person on line again kept on saying that only if the flight was rescheduled more than 60 minutes the airline would be liable for full refund; not in this case. I asked if he could guarantee that the flight would definitely take off by 1800 but he had no answer. I asked him would Air India refund my money should the flight fail to take off by 6:00 PM which was 1 hour from my originally scheduled departure, he gave some evasive answers and I realised there was no use of wasting my time with this person so I hung up.

Then I sent a series of tweets tagging @airindiain hoping that someone will take notice of it and get in touch with me but I think I had thought too highly of this hell-bound airline.

Not wanting to lose my hard earned money, I reached the airport at 4:30 PM and checked in. The checking in experience was horrible; the lady at the counter was so rude with me, I moved out of check in and went to another counter later. The boarding was to commence at 5:30 PM but started only at about 6:00 PM. After numerous announcements with apologies for the delay, the flight took off at around 6:45 PM and landed at Delhi at around 8:50 PM. Despite this delay, the airline neither offered pre-flight meals to the passengers at Mumbai nor did they serve dinner in flight (serving only snacks instead).

I am contemplating taking the airline to consumer court for this and advise you all not to fly Air India ever again."

Check in process takes so much of time at airports all over India. You will see long long queues for check in. No system of allotment of seats. They will never honour or listen your request. No announcement about delayed departures. Staff is least bothered about passengers comfort. Staff is so arrogant and unprofessionally trained. In case you request them to put FRAGILE tag on baggage, they will never find tag available with them. Even if you are able to put FRAGILE tag rest assure you will find something broken or damaged. Air India always has disappointed me.I have flown with Air India more than 200 times and my experience has always been disappointing. About hospitality they know nothing. You will be welcomed by old age Air Hostess with angry looks and no smile on there face at all. Very rarely you will see Air Hostess with smile and ready to listen to you. They are so rude. I don't know what type of hospitality training has been given to them by Govt operated Air line. Food quality and presentation is very normal even on International flights. Most of time you will find seats are torn and table try broken. Entertainment channels broadcast very old movies and sometimes it doesnt work itself. No body seems to be bothered to improve the Air India services. So next time pay little extra and travel by other private airlines and enjoy the hospitality with smile and comfort of travel. As most of travellers might have faced some other discomfort travelling with Air India and I think most of travellers may agree with me ."

Air India always has good announcements unlike private Indian airlines where the pilot and the stewards just rush through their words.

There is no handy place to keep your personal stuff , and you have to stretch out to the pocket at the back of the seat in front of you to fetch your book/specs/water bottle etc., and if you are short like me, you will have to get off the seat to reach for them. The food is pathetic - both Indian and continental options, except the kebabs which were served soon after take off from Delhi. The service could have been much better. I had a window seat fortunately - I felt sorry for the person in the middle seat of the central column - an aisle seat in economy would have been hundred times better, and at a much lower cost.

Business Class",An unfortunate delay/delay/delay,"Unfortunately we were met with the ""20 min delay "" sign, when we arrived on time in Bangkok. This turned out to be a euphemism for the best part of two hours, resulting in a missed connection in Delhi.

The anticipated trip in the Dreamliner was already turning sour. Indeed we were so late we nearly missed the flight to London, to which we had been transferred- whilst originally scheduled to fly into Birmingham.

The Dreamliner is, in our opinion a bit of a misnomer. Yes, it seems quieter, but the hideous blue tinge inflicted on passengers is something that no doubt reads well in the advertising, but does not work in practice.

To be fair the staff could not have done more to transfer us across the airport in Delhi to make the connection- to no avail as we then spent another 45 mins waiting to depart.

Departure was then not in the second advertised ""Dreamliner"" but in one of the scruffiest 777's I have ever seen. On board the service and food was ""homely"" and the toilet to be avoided at all costs. We were grateful to land at the same time as the pilots. Upon landing at Heathrow we spent the next 20 mins trying to get back across the runway to taxi to our stand. Upon arrival at the stand I was surprised to see that we did not have the usual ""batmen"" to usher us in. After another 25 mins spent looking at the wall courtesy of the nose camera, two ""batmen"" arrived, moved us back about a metre, forward a metre and then we shut down.

Our problems were not over, however, as we now had to find the transport to take us back to Birmingham. After another 30 minutes we managed to find someone who knew where the Air India desk was, only to discover it was shut and we had no means of finding who was going to take us to Birmingham. Lady Luck shined on us as , by chance, the gentleman I spoke to knew that someone was in the back of the Air India desk. Suffice to say, after a further delay collecting other passengers, who were equally bewildered, we set off for Birmingham.

I fully realise delays are a part of life. It is exactly this situation that brings out the best, or worst, in an airline. In this case, our first trip with Air India will be our last as it is difficult to see how much more could have gone wrong and how little Air India did to resolve the problems."

Business Class",Quite disappointed in the Maharaja,"Its sad to see Air India, India's flagship carrier, a carrier which used to be one of the top tier airlines, be so riddled with government interference that they forget their ultimate reason for being there - the passengers.

Business class fares are ridiculously priced - CCU - DEL - CCU ( 2 hour flight) will put you back by about $1000. Traveling to Singapore is cheaper! Its as if you are not supposed to take a domestic flight in business class - the same sectors set you back by about $200 if its part of an international itinerary.

Air India deploys its 787 class of aircrafts for some of the CCU - DEL - CCU flights. These are still very comfortable although some seats have started becoming faulty.

Choice of food is very limited but is dependent on the time of day. I tend not to eat anything on these short flights when its breakfast, lunch or dinner time. But the snacks for the early evening flights (the ones meant for the politicians traveling between CCU - DEL) are quite good - but then you will have to be comfortable rubbing shoulders with crooked politicians.

Check-in at Delhi airport for this flight is a crazy situation as it coincides with all the long haul - Rome, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna - flights. And the airport staff being ultra efficient, it takes for ever and ever - and this is the situation in Business Class. I shudder to even think about what's happening on the other side in the Economy Class counters.

The less said about the Air India lounge (International) the better. Its a huge space. But the food is at best average. You will be denied an alcoholic drink if you are traveling in the domestic sector. The Plaza Premium lounge is a better option in all respects.

Air India does not seem to take the hint that both Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines have their own separate lounges to cater to their elite customers despite Air India being a Star Alliance member.

And finally, I fly Air India because -
1) Air India is the only Star Alliance member in India.
2) They offer direct connectivity to Calcutta for international flights - a big bonus if you wish to conduct customs and immigration on your own turf. Bombay and Bangalore customs are particularly notorious for extorting money and other benefits from incoming passengers.
3) Flights to Europe are about 1/2 price of LH and others in business class"

The quality and quantity of audio and video entertainment was also below par as compared to other airlines.

Well I was not the one of the fifty unlucky passengers. However I was one of the other flights' ovrrbooked by Air India.

In July 2016, I arrived at tje airport 2 hours before departure time. Overbooked. We were advised there are no seats for us. There seven unhappy customers. Not happy because of work following day. Placed us over night accomodation with meals, transfer.

The following day's flight was to the flight to Melbourne which was not the same as our flight destination. We got explained tje the.domestic connection flight to the final destination with Virgine Australia was arranged and to pick ticket up once we arrive at Australia. This was not true. On arrival at Melbourne airport, we are not only checked in but also we even not on tje reservation list. We waited for eight hours at the airport eventually to be boarded for the earliest available airplaine by Qantas.

Airport meal baucher propsed to compensate this eight hours' waiting time at first was only 15 dollars! It has.doubled only after I show my anger but think of time you waste, would this worth?

I did research about the airline. Air India has policy that says they have right to overbook passengers only for US market.There was no document placed regarding overbooking policy as of Aug 2016. E ticket did not mention.about it in the condition list. I am Australian customer so their entitlement of overbooking does not apply to me.

After retuning to Australia I found an email sent to me before one day leaving my original flight. I was a tourist in the country so I did not have access to email at the time.
It said, 'Please be at airport to check in FIVE HOURS BEFORE THE DEPARTURE TIME AS ' because overbooking were forcasted.

Thanks for the email. However one may wonder what kind of airline whom people desire to travel if your purchsed ticket does not guarantee your seat unless you check in that rediculously earlier hours......

However, it does not applies with my flight with air india. They only offer limited food. In the second course, they offer tea and coffe by carrying two kettle arround with the attidie like in a bus in Indonesia: so uncaring. The flight attendant is not only old (which I think it is still oke because seniority sometimes mean more profesional service) but also not neatly dressed. Oh yes....as I rushed to the airport (my taxi is late)...their flight is also late. The groundstaff is really helpfull, but I can not recall whether they are from the airport or represent the airline.

Not only their livery feels old, but the interior and carpet too. Hope their international flight is better."

I had a doubt that I might miss the flight from Delhi for short layout time.
Just few months ago, one of my friend missed the same flight from Delhi.

However in my case, it departed at right time but reached Delhi at 12:55 PM (delay of about 50 minutes). I was sure, that I will miss the flight.
However, AI guys helped me and my family to rush and literally we were running in the airport and somehow we were the last passengers.

Felt very lucky but after immigration in Paris pour luggage was missing.
I reported missing luggage and AI team assured me that they will contact and deliver the luggage to our apartment in 24 hours.

At last got the luggage in 48 hours.

Overall journey was comfortable. The quality of the foods in the flight were awesome and very tasty. They always keep you busy with foods and drinks.

Dreamliner flight so, it's all latest gadgets and front screen loaded with good movies in English, Hindi and other regional languages. You can charge your tab and mobile from the usb panel.

I would suggest, if you guys plan Air India, never take a connecting layout short. At least keep some good buffer time so you don't miss your connecting flight.
Try to paste a paper on your checked in luggage mentioning your flight no , destination and your contact number, that case there will be little chance of missing your luggage."

When I arrived in New Delhi the Birmingham flight was not displayed on the departure boards and there were no announcements regarding the flight. After asking many people I was informed that the flight was cancelled and that I had to fly to London.
This Flight was delayed due to the fact that people weren't happy and that the staff in New Delhi completely miss handled the situation, and the main member of staff kept walking off rather than dealing with the situation. Not to mention he only spoke in Hindi to the passengers so me and other non Indian people had to keep asking other passengers to find out what was happening.
Other than staff incompetence, I could have booked a flight to London for considerably cheaper with a better airline and arranged for someone to pick me up in London. Also when we arrived in London it took 2 hours for the coaches to arrive to take us to Birmingham, even though they knew we were coming.
In conclusion my friend wasted his time coming to Birmingham at 18:00 to pick me up. My journey turned in to 28 hours instead of 15 hours. The staff in New Delhi and in the UK were completely incompetent. Most importantly i paid for a flight to Birmingham and was sent to London when i could have purchased a cheaper ticket if I had wanted to fly to London.
I have complained via email to Air India and received no response for almost a month."

They said they would arrange hotel stays until the next flight the next morning. It took about 3 or 4 hours before we actually arrived at the hotel half a mile away (Holiday Inn). The longest and most tiring 3/4 hours of my life.

For the 10pm departure, I left NOIDA at 7 & reached the airport at 8.15. Yes, I did succumb to the airport upgrade that cost U$300, but it took 30 minutes to get done. The counter asked one of the valets to accompany me, and it was Aman, the same one we helped me with the family the previous week. He greeted me as if I was god, so maybe the U$7 tip I gave him last time was a bit much!

For the smokers, there are 2 areas – one next to food court on the upper level, the other near Gate 15.

Departure was from gate 26, the last one, so a bit of a walk. But I was greeted chirpily. There were 9 people in the 18 business seats, so we were well spread out. It’s a comfortable flatbed, with a blanket & a duvet (this is given out later as a I found out when I work up after dinner to go to the loo when I found it draped over me). I watched Person of Interest, had chicken for dinner. I thought that packaged milk & sugar was a bit much for business. I always feel cold onboard and had forgotten the light sweater I normally get with me, so wore the top of the white pyjamas we were given (a strange colour).

In the morning I was woken up with a towel & went back to sleep after putting the seat upright. Immigration, luggage & getting taxi were, as usual, very smooth at Changi and I was home an hour after touch-down."

Fortunately I did it 24 hours earlier, else due to my ticket conditions, would have paid U$120 extra had I not. Air India’s website is great as it requires us to scroll through the conditions before buying, but people like me do so without reading them.

The relatively new International Terminal 2 also has domestic departures for non low cost airlines like Air India & Jet. I left Altamount Road at 8.15AM, and despite the rain, was at T2 in 38 minutes. The sealink & the turnoff from the highway to T2 really helps. Check-in & immigration took 12 minutes. T2 has a smoking room, located opposite the Street Food by Punjab Grill where you can pick up a masala tea. The GVK lounge was superb – large, airy, great views of the airport, quick wifi & a wide choice of Indian food. It could do with sockets for international chargers.

On board, its best to ask for blankets/ pillows asap as supply is limited. I missed a great plane spotting picture as there were an Emirates 777 & 6 A320/B737s in the queue behind us. On the left side of the runway was the Air India hanger with many 747s, the Queen of the Skies as far as I am concerned.

In the plane, I had dropped my glasses and one of the passengers pointed it out to me else I would not have found them.

While being fed the meal, the crew gave the “veg/ non-veg” options without specifying what each was. For regular Indian’s “non-veg” is a must ask as we think paying for “veg” is a waste! I took the veg option & it was super.

Air India economy (not business) distributes small packets of delicious churan that one may miss. Its in the plastic packet that has the sugar/ milk for tea/coffee, so if you like this, look for it there.

When I landed, my mobile was dead, but I found that in the luggage carousel area they have international charger sockets, but you need your charger. One of the friendly luggage assistants allowed me to use his phone so I could connect with the home contingent that had come to pick me up. Airport to NOIDA in 3 hours with stops enroute at 2 bookshops, Nizams Kathi Kebabs in Def Col & picking up my nephew at his bus stop in Moolchand. Direct would have probably taken 1 hour."

The benefits of their recent entry to Star Alliance is super for passengers with priority check-in, lounge access & boarding. The airport upgrade for Singapore Delhi was about U$300 & was available, but I didn’t take it as I am supposed to be on a budget & it was an evening flight.

Air India was one of the first Boeing Dreamliner customers & that has enhanced their capability & service. The 787-8’s are beginning to look a bit dated though. I had booked the exit row 11A, but as the plane was quite empty and the armrests don’t go up in this row, one of the crew showed me to a row further back where I could stretch out, and I did. I love Indian food, but I asked for Chinese style chicken, thinking it was Indian Chinese food, but it was Chinese Chinese food and not to my taste. The headsets were those difficult to use ones like one uses on mobile phones, but the helpful crew gave me one of the much nicer Bose-lookalikes. I saw Nobody Killed Jessica, the incredible story of how a politicians son first gets away with murder, and then one persons crusade gets justice.

Though I have flown extensively, I saw for the first time a doctor onboard tending to a passenger, who fortunately was soon fine. In the normal Indian style there was a gaggle of people watching from the sidelines.

We landed 30 minutes early, and there was a busy business class passenger talking loudly on his phone. I have come across may people like this – once I was in London on my blackberry at a restaurant & someone asked me if I working on a hostile takeover!

I took the long walk to immigrations, wondering whether my PIO card would still work. As a back-up I had some passport pictures to get a Visa on Arrival if needed. The PIO worked, but after a lot of questions as I had got an eVisa for my past trip. Indian duty free is mainly alcohol, cigarettes, chocolates & cosmetics, the normal purchases of returning Indians. One will not find the huge choice as in Changi Singapore which is a large transit hub. The prices are very good though.

The money changing rates in Bombay are not though, with commissions being charged unlike before. The new terminal doesn’t have any Indian bank counters, whose rates are the best & do not charge commissions. I took an air conditioned taxi for U$10 to Altamount Road where I was staying with friends. It was 11PM and I was disappointed not to find any of the awesome “cutting” street tea available, my first “todo” when I reach Bombay, but I more than made up the next day."

When asked why was it not informed , they have a same reply as always we tried your number but nobody answered the call"

International

Well, Air India always seems to disappoint me and it never changes. I have flew with Air India about four times and my experience has always been disappointing, troubled and angered.

Almost every time I flew with Air India, the flight seems to be delayed. Just a year ago when I was transiting via Mumbai to Muscat, a delay in the flight from Kolkata, made me nearly miss my Air India flight to Muscat by minutes. Let me just talk about my case right now. I flew last night from Muscat, which was supposed to take off at 11pm but because of a delay it flew at 12.15am making me wait. Okay that’s not much time. When I landed in New Delhi, it was almost 5.30 am and then I was really worried. My next flight to Kolkata via Air India boarded at 6.30am so I had only an hour to go through immigrations, customs, domestic airport transfer, check-in and boarding and one hour seemed really less. Still, literally running from the flight, rushing in the queues and madly running in the airport I rushed and reached the domestic terminal at 6.30 am. Then, ta-da the flight is delayed to 8.30 am. I have not slept the entire night and then now I have to spend another two hours waiting. That’s not it, after waiting for some time, I hear the announcement that the flight has been delayed to 9.30 am and may get even more delayed and would be informed so I have nothing to do, dead tired and sleepy, in the airport with my laptop, typing this.

Ok lets not just talk about flight delays. I am a hospitality major graduate and have been working in the hospitality industry so I know what it means but I suppose Air India staffs know nothing about hospitality. I am not placing my views because of one incident but every incident that I have experienced with Air India which makes me give this conclusion. I still remember it was my first flight in Air India and I had just boarded the flight. The airhostesses weren’t like the young beautiful ones that we usually see, but well age is just a number so I didn’t give much of a big deal to it and sat down in my seat. I was welcomed by angry looking airhostesses who didn’t have a single sign of smile in their faces and this happened every time I am in an Air India flight. You never see a friendly, smiling airhostess in Air India but angry looking faces that reminds me of the stern looking headmistress from back in my school. I still remember once a man came out of the flight toilet and didn’t shut the door and then an airhostess came out shouting, ‘Hello Mr. why didn’t you shut the door? This is a flight, not your house!’. That was really rude. I mean just today I heard an airhostess shouting at a passenger saying, ‘Hurry up! Even I need to go home. I have been working since last night and I am tired.’ Seriously? Doesn’t the so called the Indian government owned airline have trainings for hospitality and customer service to their staffs? I have heard so many negative comments used by the staffs on-board and not a single positive moment.

Let’s not talk about in-flight services. The food totally sucks. Like today in an International flight, I was serviced a small can of beer and when I asked for another one, the airhostess pretended not to hear me, even when I called her like thrice. The food was terrible, especially in an International flight that I didn’t eat it. There was rice, a little dal with it and 2 small chunks of chicken, a slice of bread and small chunks of cucumber and tomatoes for salad. The seats was a little old and torn and the television entertainment was terrible with only two working channels, with one broadcasting a 15 year old Bollywood movie, Hum Saath Saath Hai and another broadcasting an English documentary. Plus, none of the passenger were provided with ear phones and most earphone plugs didn’t work as well.

So next time I book my flight, I’ll make sure I pay a little more but not book a ticket with Air India and I suppose there are many people who feels the same way."

The flight was not completely full, and even though I was unable to select seats in online check-in (this function seems to have disappeared in the past couple of months, was available previously), at check-in the agent was pleasantly helpful and re-seated us to a block of three seats in the middle with the center seat empty, which makes all the difference in the world.

The flight itself was fine, the new 787-s are still in a good shape unlike the older aircraft. The seat is rather tight & narrow (3-3-3 config in economy), but with the middle one left empty it was fine, and the legroom is better than most other airlines these days. Inflight service was nothing exceptional, but perfectly fine for the relatively short flight.

Overall it was certainly a much better choice than the alternative red-eye flight ."

Call Centre: My interaction with the call centre was actually very good. We had to reschedule our flight from Kolkata to Delhi and it was done for free by calling the call centre. The process was quick and hassle free.

Airport Staff are quite friendly. Check in process was smooth enough. Ground staff at Delhi airport were quite helpful in aiding the international transfer.

The aircraft itself has to improve. There were some shabby patchworks (especially seat upholstry and remote of the entertainment system). The international flight was a wee bit better than the domestic flight, though not great.

Cabin Crew were friendly. Response time can improve. However the worst experience of this entire trip was on our flight from Paris to Delhi, there seemed to be a shortage of water on board. The crew served half filled glasses everytime a passenger asked for water. This was completely unacceptable.

The food was above average. Nothing to write home about.

The customer service in the Airports is NON Existent and even the general ground staff could not tell us what was happening as Air India had not told them when they cancelled our connecting flight and left us for 8 hours in no man lands in Mumbai airport!!
The Final insult was in Dehli on our final flight when we where told after waiting in chaos in checkin that the flight was overbooked as they had cancelled a previous flight & put the passengers from that on our flight & bumped us off - leaving us stranded in Dehli airport for 24 hours they did give us a hotel (Hotel Centaur) which I would not let my neighbours dog sleep in it was so decrepid with mould half way up the walls and plaster falling off ,live bare electric wires and dirt, stains and dust everywhere, The airport staff where downright rude and ignorant and ignored us when we returned to the airport to advise we would not stay in the provided hotel,
Upon eventual return to the uk I have tried to get compensation from them for the many delays we encounted (32 hours in total & travellling with children)and found again that I am yet again totally ignored by the customer services and am now taking them to the small claims court as they are in breach of the Indian Aviation code of conduct -I a nutshell - would I fly with them again? - no id rather crawl there on my hands & knees!!!"

Economy",After 4 months there is now a promise of the refund due to me.,"When I booked this flight it was a through service from DEL to BOM, stopping at UDR. Bookings with Indian airlines tend to be changed quite frequently; in this case it stopped being a through service, with the DEL - UDR leg being operated by an aircraft which then returned to DEL, and a new flight being put on BOM - UDR - BOM. The new timing was inconvenient, but left us with no choice.

Although my booking was in Business Class, a last-minute aircraft substitution on the day meant that a Y class only A320 operated this rotation, although this wasn't properly explained when I checked in. Once the situation was clear I was at least given seat 1C, with my (Y class) travelling companions allocated 2A, B and C.

An efficient young lady took details of my booking and returned with a print out which she assured me would lead to an automatic refund. That didn't happen. Some weeks later I e-mailed AI in Mumbai, with no response. A letter to AI's London office elicited no response. Use of AI's feedback form has led to a reply at least, with a promise of a refund, but I'm not holding my breath.

And I was only given Y class points.

Somewhat bizarrely we landed at the International side of Delhi Airport and had to find the 'International' desk for domestic passengers. Beyond there the transfer to departures was smooth.

AI's lounge at Delhi is good, with acceptable refreshments (although being India, no alcohol). The gate was announced and the sign said that boarding was in progress, but as I approached the gate there was the characteristic air of the crew awaiting the inbound aircraft, even when we were shown as boarding. The crew were very jolly and told me where the inbound aircraft was coming from, which enabled me to locate it on Flightradar24 and tell them where it was!

The jolliness continued to Udaipur, although I'm sorry that my time had been wasted by being called to the gate far earlier than was required."

I was surprised that Air India doesn't have its own lounge at CCU, although the ladies operating the lounge which AI does use were charming. The biggest surprise was just how shabby the interior of the Business Class cabin on the 787 was.

The timing of the flight was such that I really only wanted coffee on this leg, although I'm afraid that wasn't all that good either.

In the past I've been advised to steer clear of AI because of its unreliability. This was my first flight with the airline (of three during this visit to India); I'm afraid that it is fairly obvious that this is still a state-owned airline."

Air India's check in was in Gate 3-4 in Delhi's T3 (changed from Gate 1-2 since my last flight in December). The Star Alliance Gold counters were opposite the economy ones so took a minute to find them. Keep your Gold card handy as they verify. Check in was quick, as was immigration, where we used the Special Assistance queue as we had young kids. An airport valet (a new service) accompanied us and took us to the First/ Business security queue as we were Gold members. After some hesitation, the guard let us through. His name was Dutta and I asked if he was Bengali, but he actually was Assamese (same as me) and we exchanged smiles as if we were old friends!

We went to the Air India lounge, which as expected is much closer than the other ones. The Valet has a sticker saying no tips, but we gave him Rs 500 (about U$7). I had to retrieve my daughter who always walks into the First Class section! The food was good and I had a farewell helping of Indian Chinese food, the best Chinese food in the world as any Indian will tell you.

The gate was a bit far, there were no golf carts available to take us there (normally omnipresent) and the travellators were not working so it was a trudge. Processes have streamlined and security at the gate doesn't any longer check for stamps from the earlier security check. We were greeting at the Dreamliner door by 2 cheery crew and made our way to rows 21/2. The interior was clean & neat and we settled in.

A few minutes later, a man came to me asking if I would switch to a seat 2 rows behind but I said no as I wanted to next to my family. I knew he was a honeymooner as his wife had the giveaway set of bangles many newly married Indian brides have. He was persistent & came back asking if I would be willing to sit in the middle seat in my row so he could switch someone else and get to sit next to his bride. I had an aisle seat, it was a red eye & I was flying economy. But the incurable romantic that I am, I succumbed. Hope God was watching and saw the good deed!

Air India starts inflight entertainment immediately (I love that) and I watched this great movie ""The Judge"" with Robert Downey Jr. The dinner served was tasty (I chose chicken tikka). The gentlemen who came to sit next to me (part of the honeymooners switching seats arrangement) was clearly more charming than me. He got a 2nd helping of the chicken, while I had been refused it when I had asked in my incoming flight!

After the movie I slept a couple of hours, and we landed soon after in Singapore. Immigration was smooth, our luggage came quickly and we were soon on our way back to home sweet home.

Except for better lounge-to-gate access at Delhi airport, I don't think I found anything lacking in this experience, and Air India's delivery was very good. Will certainly continue on Air India back to India."

Food was terrible, seat cushions filthy, overhead compartments shaking terribly upon take-off, carpets dirty and partially off the seams in the aisle.
FYI, I've spent many years as an aircraft engineer for the Air Force, never seen any commercial airline in this bad shape. Food was horrible, lavatories unsanitary and air hostess never came once after meals during the 7hr flight. One other individual who was also an American on the way back home made the same mistake and opted for Air India as I did. He and I both held our immediate use of the toilet until we landed at O'Hare. Upon landing at O'Hare, right next to was....the PIA flight from LHR which departed a few minutes before our flight, he and I both recognized the tail number. A newer 777. Go figure.

The only good experience I had with AI was flying Business Class from Hong Kong to India in 2004. And the Senior Flight Attendant was very friendly; I assume because I was carrying a guitar and his son was pursuing studies in Music specializing in Guitar. That was the end of my good experience with AI.

After the flight last time I had promised myself not to fly AI. I did not keep it this time because of their non stop flight, and I regretted the decision. Severely.

All the other economy seats have poor legroom. I looked up the seat configuration of the flight and reserved one in the end because it had leg room of almost business class due to the way the place is designed. In think seat was 50A. That is where the good part ends.

The whole experience was poor: checkin staff, announcements, attitude of staff, interiors, seats, arms sets are either broken or not working, over-head light switches do not work most times. Food (and I did not expect fine dining for what I paid for the trip).

The extra leg room in seat 50 A on this particular aircraft type was very good. I am 6 feet tall and I could stretch y legs in full with room to spare. And the reason was that the back of the chair was broken and it reclined almost 50% more!

The worst is the toilets. Again a lot of blame goes to the passengers. Staff is also auto tuned to deal with such passengers and hence they behave the same with all passengers. Outbound AI flights from Delhi often flies many folks from rural punjab. They are loud and I am sure drive the staff nuts. And the outbound flights are almost full. The inbound flights are mostly half or less full. So one can move around and change seats if required.

And the landing was horrible. I fly lot and chances are that when landing I can tell if this is going to be a good or a poor landing. I just feel it. And I have experienced rusty landings. But the landing of inbound flight to Delhi 2 PM on May 4th 2016 was the worst I have experienced. The plane swayed for a few seconds while taxing after touchdown.

I will stop my review here. Air India could possible be the worst overall experience I have had in over 12 years of flying. And I feel bad that AI represents India to the world. The Mascot Maharaja is misrepresented.

They sent me an email receipt for the amount I paid but it did not have the seat number they had indicated over the phone, worried that this could cause a problem I called them again, but they assured me they see the two seats in their system, they just do not show them in the receipt. I trusted them but on the day at the checkin counter they first gave them regular seats, I had to argue with them for 20 mins to make them agree to give them the seats that they had sold me! It was ridiculous! My parents were to continue on to Bangalore which was another 2.5 hr journey, they were given regular seats in two different corners of the flight. My payment should have got them 2 seats with extra legroom all the way to their destination - that was what was promised when I had called the airlines 2 days before the departure. I called Air India again once the flight departed from SFO expressing the disappointment and the person on the line was very apologetic and said he could ""connect with my experience"" and that he would ensure that the two get seats with more legroom together when they reach DEL for their onward journey to BLR but turned out to be all talk.

Economy",Terrible Experience,After an advice from friend we decided to go with Air India as its timing suits to our schedule. However the experience was really bad. The aircraft by a mere look at it you can say its an old machinery. Air bus A 319 and the interiors are in bad shape too specially for the economy class. The legroom is good but beside that there was nothing which could make a good impression. The ride was a shaky one and once we landed we didn't find one of our bad after long wait it finally came out and that too WITHOUT TAG...We were extremely lucky that our luggage was not lost but it's height of irresponsibility and lack of luggage safety measures. Definitely won't fly again.

Economy",A Comfortable trip from Singapore to Delhi on the Dreamliner with the Family,"Starting with buying the tickets, the experience was great and lots of value for money. The ticket cost just a bit more than just the taxes on other airlines using miles. The website was convenient. On this, I hope Star Alliance airlines soon allow us to log in using any of our frequent flyer numbers within their network. The checkin process was smooth, as was boarding.

My wife and daughter were in row 16 and my son and I being them. The plane was one of the new generation Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with comfortable seats, modern inflight entertainment and the feel of a bright, high ceiling. The overhead luggage compartments were spacious. I like the windows on the Dreamliner as they adjust themselves to the light outside. The toilets on the side have windows which is a bit of a novelty.

The flight took 5 hours and was quite smooth. I like the fact that Air India lets the inflight entertainment continue even after landing.

I would like Air India to make their entertainment choice wider and perhaps serve the meal a little later than they do as its done 30 minutes after take off at 9am and we had just eaten a bit earlier. When I asked the stewardess for an extra omelette for my son, I was refused -this could have been handled better. Before landing, when I asked the stewardess for a pen to fill up my landing card she said they didn't have any, though I found one at the galley. Lastly, my seat back didn't recline which was a pity. Also, should include wifi soon.

Despite this, overall a very good experience that we will repeat."

After seeing all passengers they have allowed us to board the flight at around 04:35 PM, we have boarded the flight. and fasten our seat belts because we thought flight will be takeoff but no after some time all passengers are suffocating because they not even start the airplane engine and A/C has not powered on after 1 hrs. some passengers has started enquiring about the crew, we have not witnessed such condition in plane they all are lying some one is saying there is some technical problem and some saying, captain do not have experience on flying the Boeing so briefing is on and some saying they are waiting for signal from ATC air traffic controller, after listening all these things passengers are afraid now when made a call to customer care they are saying technical problem then we request them to allows us to get down from flight, on this they have telling us so many things security not allows us and all base less things.

Think the situation that if any of the passengers needs emergency, but they told us that within ten minutes flight will take off, Imagine and visualize the situation of passengers, among them i was also there, feeling suffocation, some of the co-passengers are observing fast, some came from Riyadh, some passengers families ae waiting at Hyderabad Airport since 04:30 Pm even before that time, and staff crew is giving us the false Information, technical problem, pilot do not have experience of flying Boeing.

Finally, At 06:35 flight has started, 2 hours we have spent in flight, scenario is look like we are waiting for sharing taxi and driver has not starting the taxi.
staff/crew members are good in guiding us how to fasten seat belts and other emergency situations but we ask about this situation no one tell us the truth and we have to wait for 2 hrs. in flight.

earlier also I travelled through Air India, and i had some little bad experience but this is very bad experience, I will try not to travel from this Airline."

So we got all the luxuries of international flight at the price less than any domestic flight would charge, however for a short duration!

I have travelled many times via Air India on other routes also. Their only problem is that their flights are getting delayed many times. It may be due to inherent lethargy as a govt company, or nuisances from ministers/officials. Otherwise, it is truly Maharaja of aviation industry."

This time we did not too many options and this particular flight fit our timings well as per our requirement and also a short flight so how bad can it be.
The Inflight are almost borderline rude and dare not ask them to make exceptions to the seat or meals. Food was really bad, over fried samosas or pattice. kababs did not taste good at all, my son puked immediately.
On our way back the inflight entertainment did not work, when complained this steward tells me I will have to complain about it only once I land and he could give me the complaint form....how proactive! When asked for a seat change they refused to help inspite of the flight being empty and most of them had moved seats on their own. So we paid to be sincere and sitting on our own allotted seats. The senior stewardess says she cannot help and we should go request others if they can swap seats....a test to your patience level. So what do we do for the next 5 hours without the entertainment system we asked? nothing - they say.
Unless I am carrying my own food and my phone loaded with movies and I have no option to take any other airlines, I will take Air India."

• I was booked and Confirmed in Economy class for AI 314 / 17 June for DEL-HKG flight under ID00R1
• I was availing this ticket from my Father who had served Indian Airlines for more than 30 years and retired as GM - Civil
• I reported the Executive Check- in counter at 2000 hours and requested for my Economy Boarding card and at the same time checked the possibility of upgrade to Executive Class
• The outsourced check in staff ( the ones in orange uniform ) had to struggle to find Air India staff to seek guidance on the Executive class which finally she found one after 20 minutes
• She informed me that sir the Executive class is light and we will upgrade you from here only but you will have to wait till 2100 hours
• I had No choice to wait till 2100 hours and I again approached the counters at 2105
• To my surprise the shift had changed and there was new staff and I had to give them the whole story why I am here
• This time it was a guy and he tried locating the Air India staff in the Delhi Airport. He tried for 10 minutes , Called many numbers and finally gave up as no one was available
• He took my baggage, issued the baggage tags and requested me to come back at 2130 and assured if they couldn’t find anyone they will issue me a Executive Boarding card
• Again No choice I went and sat and again reported at 2135 in a hope that I will get my boarding card now
• Now the challenge in front of him was from whom to take the limit in Executive class but luckily he could locate someone who helped with the limit and finally the boarding card was issued in Executive Class – Seat 3D
• I cleared immigrations , Security checks and waited for my boarding announcements at Gate 15
• Boarding announcements were done and I headed towards the boarding gate
• From here starts the episode of Corruption , Rude Behavior , Favouritsm , Mental Torture
• Before entering the Boarding gate the staff scans the boarding card again and to my surprise the staff informed me that I have been downgraded because “ THERE ARE NO MEALS ON BOARD AND CATERING ALSO HAS REFUSED TO GIVE EXECUTIVE CLASS MEALS NOW”
• I told the staff I do not want meals and I am ready to give this in writing but they rudly replied we can not allow you to sit in Executive class
• I had no choice then to proceed for boarding . I went in the Aircraft and spoke to the Cabin Incharge . I do not remember his name but he is a South Indian and a bit on a fatty side.
• He rudly replied you want meals or Not , I wont allow you to sit in Executive class .
• I had no choice again to keep cool and complete my Journey but I did inform him that I will take this issue to the highest authority , Social media and If required to press
• In few minutes an Air India staff comes to the Aircraft in Uniform along with 1 thin gentlemen with less hair , 2 young boys age between 9-12 , 1 Boy age around 15 and 1 girl age around 8 years and directly took them to Executive class and informed something to the Cabin In charge.
• To my surprise the Girl occupied the 3D seat and others also settled around in Executive class
• Once all these settled the Air India Staff went out in the aero bridge along with the Cabin incharge who came back in 8-10 minutes and informed that the person who downgraded my seat is Rajat Kumar Sharma
• I did tell him what do I do with this name and how do I know who is he . Without Air India staffs instructions no one can down grade my seat

I want to highlight here the amount of CORRUPTION and Favouritism Air India Ground Staff has. To send their own people in comfort they can do anything and they have no fear of anyone after all it’s the government owned airline and who can question them . It has happened to me today and this might be happening on most of the routes. Had those been 6 paid guests the staff wouldn’t have lied that there is no Executive class meals on board that’s why downgraded. Their lie came immediately in front once these guests came and occupied the seats. If you honestly screen the flight there will another case of Free upgrade to Executive Class . There was a gentleman along with his son travelling on same flight. The gentleman was booked in Business class and son in economy class. They both approached the Executive class check in counter and the father spoke to the staff and informed that there should be a message for his sons upgrade and to my surprise the lady issued both business class boarding cards without charging a single penny . If am not wrong both of them occupied 2A, 2C seats .

Today Air India proudly to be member of Star Alliance but how they treat the employees from other Airlines is a big shame specially the employees who have served the Airline for years and now retired . Today it’s me , tomorrow it can be staff from any other Star Alliance member Airline and one day it will reach to the ears of Star Alliance management on the behavior of Air India staff how they treat their internal customers . Imagine how the external customers are being treated on-board."

I cannot believe this airline still exists....an hour flight from Leh to Delhi should have been a no brainer - I should have checked the reviews prior to booking.

1). Notification that the flight was going to depart 1 hour earlier was received a mere 12 hours prior - which, was lucky I received the email given Wifi is patchy at best in Leh the town I was departing from. Got up at 4am to get to the airport for the earlier departure time, only to find out it left at the originally scheduled time anyway - so why send me a notification of a change to get there earlier!??!!?!??!?!!?
2) Plane was grubby - artefacts from previous flight still in the seat pocket (dirty food/drink bottles etc).
3) Waited for departure while some locals thought they were too important for their economy seat. Waited and waited for them to argue with staff re: the upgrade, then shift to new seats, only to return 10 minutes later to economy - a great use of time obviously.
4) Customer service non existent on flight and food was miserable.
5) Told before departing I can only have valuables in hand luggage, forced to take out toothbrush, change of clothes and other items you would normally take ""just in case"" - what a mistake see point 6!
5) Arrived at destination only to be told by another customer that they had forgotten to load the WHOLE FLIGHTS LUGGAGE. No notification from the airline while standing like an idiot at the baggage carousel. Had to proceed to their counter jostling with other clients to figure out what was going on - no explanation of why luggage wasn't loaded, when it would be expected, no apology from staff. I was staying overnight in Delhi and flying to Sydney the next day right at the end of my holiday. Shifty staff trying to get me to send luggage direct to Sydney - no I am not leaving the country without my luggage. Arranged to pick up the next day at the same airport. Other clients mentioned this issue occurred the day before so I'm sure they used our flight to send the previous days luggage.
6) Got to the airport early to pick up luggage from the day before, had to buy replacement clothes, cosmetic basics (lucky hotel was next to a shopping mall and I have travel insurance). Again shifty staff tried to get me to send luggage to Sydney rather than bring it to me, had to demand my own luggage to be bought to me (based on my experience with this airline there was no way I was leaving my luggage in their useless hands). Was laughed at by the Air India staff member each time I demanded my luggage multiple times. I requested access to the lounge so I could at least have a shower and change into my clean clothes they had held hostage for over 24 hours. Staffmember flatly lied that there was no lounge, to which I showed their internet site stating the it does exist - normal entry was a measly $10USD they could not even wave for me after being inconvenienced!

Blatant lack of recognition that people have actually paid them money for some degree of service. An air of arrogance that somehow staff believe they are doing us a favour by flying their airline. It is pretty abysmal that an airline cannot even get the fundamentals right by loading a WHOLE FLIGHTS luggage (this is even after you check in, you have to go outside and point to your luggage to identify it to get it loaded!).

If I was an Indian national, I would be extremely embarrassed that this was my national airline and representative of my country.

Will never fly with Air India again, and I will be telling as many people I can about how horrendous this poor excuse for an airline is so no one else makes the same mistake I did. Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for!"

The food offered was not so good & the overall service is average. The flight tickets are expensive as compared to other airlines. The food offered is also better but not best. Many ia times air india tries to prove that, that being an public sector, they are not bothered whether the customer is satisfied or disatisfied. I would not recommend this service unless you are left with no option. as many a times air india flights get delayed & the customer loyalty programs of Air india is not attractive , if you compare it with their peer group. All in all not so good experience"

You can hardly travel with them without any problem. Problem is an integral part of this Airline and so it is better to avoid Air India if you want a tension free journey. God has many more work to do, hence He may not always give you special attention when you travel Air India.
I have heard that Air India is doing better during last one year. I will be happy if this is true.
However I must mention 3 very strong positives about this Airline:-
1. Good in flight food. Probably the best in the Indian sky today.
2. Their Call center. You will be connected to an executive probably within a minute.
3. New generation of flight attendants who work with great enthusiasm.

Would be happy to see the Indian Maharaja doing better than others."

Could do with better cutlery and crockery and also the tray and service.
No amenities given.
But the flight timings are great and you arrive at the time immigration is empty. Just perfect.
Way to go for air India."

The Airline is most preferred for family for journeys upto 9 times in a Year between Middle East Dubai and Mumbai India.

Middle Class, Business Class and executives could avoid this airline in History owing to class of travel or name associated with their journey. But the Airline is wonderful in terms of everything thats said as ""Maharaja Service at cheapest Quality"".

When booking Airline titkcets via thrid party service providers one may not even get the Airlineon the Radar as its prices are so cheap sometimes that Agents cannot afford the earning margins.

Always recommended to book tickets directly from their Website.

The Airline provides excellent food service. High Quality Food menu and with a taste thats equialent to any good Restaurant with taste reviews at Top,

The Airline provides excellent service in terms of Luggage handling and also gives levy on putting extra kilos in checked in baggage when one cannot carry his own hand baggage .

The Airline provides excellent service to senior citizens and takes care to help them provide necessary travel help at the airport and until they exit airport successfully and without hassles.

The Airline doesnot compromise on hygiene or cleanliness or Full flight service standards as it make sure that passenger moves in and out of Airline with a good review and good feeling throghout.

The entire Negative tainted image of this Airline is now revamped with a cheapest ticket fares that couldnot be got from any Private airlines, the airlines service standards food Quality are far better than the Provate airlines and Airlines service standards are provided at par or above the Prvate Airlines. there is literally no compromise on any aspect of the Airline as compared to the the cheap ticket rates it offers that cannot be imagined in the peak and non peak periods of travel.

I recommend this Airline to be favourites of all as this is the ony Airline that caters to all masses qually and doenot compromise on anything but gives the cheapest fares to all against any other airlines compared on the similar direct Route.

I am confident that the new government has taken allsteps to ensure the Airline comesinto a top league as well as serivces its passengers with great Maharaja effect.

Best partis legroom and seat comfort for fat people. If you are fat they make sure they put yu in seat that has none besides yu so as yu can adjust comfortably.

Request all to please do help Airline come up in its service standards by believeing and respecting its Staff. The staff is well dressed very polite , excellent warmth and simply no Attitude in age group 35-40 unlike the crew at other private airlines in age group of 20-25. The airline staff has been found to be more mature, understanding and warmth to each passengers requirements.

Make sure you book it directly on their website airindia.com"

Requests are often ignored, they were resentful of providing both ice and lemon in the drinks, but worst of all, not a single bathroom was cleaned in the entire 12+ hour flight. By the time the flight ended, the bathroom floors were wet with dirt and who knows what, wet tissues surrounded the basins, and the toilet bowels themselves could have done with a good scrub. Furthermore, they also failed to collect rubbish, which mounted in the aisles. When they came by with their trolleys to hand out the food, they simply rolled over the used tissues, wayward plastic bags, spilt peanuts."

This meant that our family was always seated separately. We were able to ask kindly strangers to move a couple of times, so that at least we were closer, but we saw several families having to do the same.
We like curry, so enjoyed the first two meals, but the croissant we were given at the end of one flight was dry and very underwhelming- a minor issue. Some of the cabin crew were really sweet with the young children on board, some were quite abrupt with some passengers.
The toilet on one flight had fittings that were held on by masking tape! There was plenty of air freshener sprayed in the toilet but it got quite dirty by the end of the flight.

There were three of us travelling and only 2 pieces of luggage arrived in Delhi. We spent 2 nights there and the luggage had not arrived so we rang and asked that the luggage NOT be delivered to our hotel in Delhi as we were leaving for Nepal, but to Kathmandu airport where we could pick it up from the airport.They insisted it would come to our hotel in Kathmandu, so OK, they had that address. We heard nothing and so I contacted NZ who said they would try and follow-up the luggage. After another 24 hours we rang to check the status and were told it was at our hotel in Delhi...and we were in Nepal. We were going trekking and I needed the trekking gear! After initially saying that we would need to pick the luggage up from Delhi we persuaded them (after several phone calls and the help of our hotel staff) to send it to Kathmandu. They assured us it would come to our hotel. It didn't. We stayed an extra day in Kathmandu while the rest of our party left for Pokhara. Happily though, the next day we went to the luggage area in Kathmandu and found it, and 5 days after losing it we were joyfully reunited!

Because our return flight was late leaving Kathmandu, we were led through the transit process in Delhi Airport by a very officious young man who would not let us wait for each other (remember we were seated in different parts of the plane so we disembarked a few minutes apart). We finally caught up at a security check point. Then we were raced through the airport, hurry hurry, quickly... so that we felt we had to literally run or miss the plane. One woman was quite stressed by the whole episode. Then our guide suddenly stopped at the last security check-point and waved us through to the other side in the main part of the terminal, with no indication of which gate we were going to. We found an information board and finally found our plane, where people were still quite leisurely boarding and the ground staff were very calm and relaxed. We boarded and waited for some time before take-off wondering what the rush had been!
I would fly Air India again, but only a single leg journey."

Being in the hospitality industry, it is the minimum requirement to greet the customers..
It seems that, the cabin crews had never go through the customer care training!!!!
No attention to details, I have requested for a non veg meal but I have received a veg one, when I asked the hostess to change it, as if I have disturbed her!!!!
It was my first travel on Air India but for sure it was the last one also
Very great efforts needed to improve your customer service!!!"
