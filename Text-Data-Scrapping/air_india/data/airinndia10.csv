Compared to other airlines they have always served the best tasting food. Service is also very good. The only downside is the flights are constantly delayed due to technical problems. They really need to see how to address that.

The food was amazing for the first time but the second time the snacks was too bad and cold croissants.

Economy",Non stop from US to India - Average,"This review is for the non stop from US to India. It has been more than a year for Air India's west coast flight from SFO to India, and I happen to enjoy the travel just recently. My overall experience has been average and there's lot of scope for improvements.

The planes, to and from SFO, were very old with crumbling hand rests an unresponsive touch screen entertainment sets. Planes too noisy and made rumbling sounds, which kind of is scary at times (it noisy with other airlines as well but these were different noise).

The check in experience in SFO was really good and smooth but not so at Delhi. The representatives take their own time to sit and service couple of customers and leave their counter for a quick break, chat with others and come back to serve next couple. This is annoying as you are standing in line to get checked in, and ready for long flight ahead. I would expect this part of the journey to be the least stressful

Inflight service is ok, needs improvement. The flight attendants must learn the customer service well and to be courteous. They were certainly better many years ago.

Food served was below par and must be addressed as it discomforts passengers on non stop long flights of 16 hours. This one is easy to fix, and should have little more options for passengers who may not like Indian food."

For god's sake, it is an international route as I had a connecting flight via New Delhi en-route Singapore. Felt like travelling on a local bus, as the personals were horrible beyond imagination. With such kind of terrible service and service personals who are really reluctant to do their jobs, how will the airlines survive?

Economy",Very impressed. Massive improvement.,"I travelled to India on the non stop flight which landed just over 7hours after taking off.
The Dreamliner aircraft was new and inside was very modern and visually pleasing.
The seats were comfortable and the leg room was quite generous as well.
The food was ok. I had a veg meal and it was enough to fil me up even though I didn’t eat everything.
I liked that the air India staff onboard offered drinks and snacks a few times during the flight. On previous flights we have had to ask for food.
The air hosts/hostesses were very welcoming and seemed more than happy to help.
The in flight entertainment was really good. A good variety of English and Bollywood tv programmes and films.
A choice of cartoons and games to keep kids busy as well.
Overall really enjoyed my flight and as it’s a direct fight to ahemdabad I would recommend this flight to those travelling with kids and the elderly or anyone who wants to get to India fast."

Though the aircraft was Boeing Dream Liner, the overall experience was just Good and not great as experienced in other airlines such as Singapore Airlines or Emirates.

The food was average. Other aspects where lot of improvement can happen are:
1) Maintenance of Toilets . Toiletries were not replaced when over. In flight entertainment of movies was barely adequate and the list ot movies was very limited - even Indian language films. For flights of about 8-10 hours basic things such as hot/ cold towels were not available.

The plus point is however, ample leg room as compared to other airlines. Landings and take-offs were were smooth- credit to pilots. Male cabin crew were stiff but efficient and probably the higher age was telling.

Overall an average experience. Could definitely improve."

Staff were really friendly as usual and the hot food was of a decent standard.
We paid 500 ir each for extra legroom seats which was worthwhile.
Only complaint was the noise as it seemed like the engine was being revved hard and then they backed off. We also had an aborted decent which did concern my wife but was not too bad as the decent was aborted at quite a high altitude.
All in all I would consider them again as they are better than all the cheap european airlines such as Flybe, Ryanair, Easy Jet etc."

Plane had just started taxing. Air hostess held it for some time, before moving the passengers to a different seat, with not such a re-assuring remark that if the oxygen starts coming out , we could be in danger. Many seats were vacated because the screen were not working. My seat refused to recline through-out the flight.
The only saving grace were the middle aged air hostesses who were efficient and helpful. Otherwise, the ground staff had given us (couple) middle seats in DIFFERENT rows when we had asked for aisle and middle seats.Who does that, specially since we were the first few to check-in.
Can you imagine such a horrible engg staff in any airlines. This was my first Dreamliner flight, and I was pretty excited about it. Air India ruined it. Completely."

They do not care about their customers at all, we booked 2 sets of flights in order to watch the Ipl but the matches were changed we asked for a flight to be changed. They straight up refused. This was out of our control so we thought they would accommodate us, they didn't. In addition, when we did fly back I checked my brand new cricket bag in and when I received it in Goa it was scraped, scratched and in less than a pleasing condition. If I was doing it again I'd use Indigo for all internal flights. If I could take another circle off I would."

So, we booked four seats on the 8.00am departure flight - online, and paid immediately by credit card.

We had an invalid, wheel-chair bound person with us, so I also booked (online) the front row seats that were available. Happily agreed to pay Rs. 500/- per seat and blocked them. However, when I tried to pay online, I got a message that I need to go to another weblink for this! This link was perpetually down. So, called Air India helpline and they said they can't help, as ""This is our system"". When I spoke about the online payment already done for the tickets and the presence of an invalid person, they said, ""Keep trying."" I even requested them to let me pay into their personal bank account number and they can pay for the seats, but they said sorry! I tried and tried and tried, but the site remained 'down'. I spoke to their higher ups and asked when I could pay on their site for the tickets, why can't I pay for the seats also, they said Sorry!

Finally, after trying for seven long hours, realised that this could be ploy to hold the front seats for ""VIPs""!

Had to push the wheel chair all the way through the Isle to seat row 16 - the seats allotted at the checkin counter!!!"

The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the ticket agent Sherif at ORD was super friendly and helpful. The airplane has very uncomfortable seats...you can feel springs or something in the seats and for a 14 hour flight this is not good. The movie selection was minimal too unless you want to watch 20 year old movies. The agents at the Hyderabad airport were awful. They gave my husband and I middle seats in rows 19 and 51 and told us the flight was full so we couldn’t sit together unless we wanted to pay them for seats together...then we would have to buy an aisle and window and ask the person in the middle to change. They wouldn’t let us buy one seat next to the middle seat we were already assigned. It was just a bad experience all together. I won’t fly air India again.
