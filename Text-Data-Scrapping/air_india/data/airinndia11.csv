Ticket booking and check in - Air India let's you select the seat while booking it online. I would recommend booking it online and selecting right seat. Online check in is allowed 48 hours before the flight. This will save you time at the check in.

I booked it so that I sit my daughters, aged 10 and 6. I tried to check in online and found that they changed our seats to different ends and sides of the aeroplane! When I contacted their ""customer support"" all they said was they apologise for any inconvenience and there is nothing they can do. I further challenged this ""customer service rep"" and asked how Air India thought it was acceptable to change my seats and have my children sitting elsewhere on the plane, to which he answered apologies for any inconvenience. The airport is also below. I am ashamed to call myself an Indian because of they way they conduct themselves. They have below zero level of customer service skills. No wonder its losing money. India as a country its airline is centuries away from the modern world. Never again!"

Business Class",Direct Flight. Low Cost. Old Planes,"Air India offers one of the few nonstop NY to Mumbai services. The Business Class fare is usually quite reasonable and the timing is great. However, don’t expect anything close to the level of service you get from any of the four or five star airlines. Seating is 2 3 2 and the plane is at least 15 years old with no upgrades since they went into service. Sleeping is ok on the 16 hour flight but not great. No separation from adjoining seat and cushions are worn and lumpy. Food service is minimal. I prefer Emirates or Qatar or Etihad. But the layover makes the trip 4 hours longer and the timing much less convenient."

Over a period of a week before the flight multiple phone calls to their call center with different answers ended up solving nothing. At check in, after waiting an hour for an airline rep to show up, we glimpsed the bureaucracy that seems to strangle the company. Our problem was eventually solved but could have been taken care of instantly if the system were not so convoluted.

Once seated, were surprised that the only alcohol offered in business class was whiskey or beer. OK, no big deal, but not to have basic soda water (only plain water was available) seemed really odd."

Let's start with the positives, good amount of legroom, more than Jet Airways. Your legs don't hit the seat in front. The luggage allowance is adequate with 2 bags at 23kg each.
Now the negatives. The planes are very dirty. We travelled on the dreamliner and they are definitely not a dream. The tray and media centres had dirt gathered in corners and sides. Broken bits of tray tables, window controls. On the return journey most of the sound for the entertainment systems was not working. Terrible that passengers had to endure the long journey without any entertainment.
The food was terrible. On both journeys breakfast was an ice cold croissant with a slice of ice cold plastic cheese, tiny cold muffin.
I'd heard Air India served great food and had nice dreamliner. I didn't experience any of those. Planes looked like they were falling apart inside and the food was the standard of food you got at service stations in the 80's."

Thats to much, you need to buy a suitcase - but there was nothing to buy it - they send me with a guy which works there to the duty free but they don`t let me enter even with the official guy not - ok back to check in - no way - ok then i send 10 kg of my things in 2 trash backs over sea.. i need to put a foil again over my bag - still 30 kg - so she said 7 kg over the 23 kg for one piece - then i need to pay 150 CHF and then i could check in - after this nightmare i got a bad seat for both flights and the woman on the check in told me - you know you are one of the last once because you take so long for everything...
BELIEVE ME 2x 23 KG mean 2 times and not one piece with more then 23 kg
The best of the story was the official guy from AIR INDIA which told the woman on the desk the follow thing:
YOU KNOW SHE IS FROM SWITZERLAND THEY HAVE MONEY SHE CAN PAY!!!

Eventually we were taken to the Business Class lounge where we were at last able to get a coffee - this turned out to be the most pleasurable part of our experience! On the plane after the rather indifferent meal, the cabin crew darkened the windows & turned out the lights! WHY? This was a daytime flight. The cabin crew were extremely scruffy - unbelievable - & very offhand. During the flight drinks were offered only once. When I rang for some water, eventually I was given some in a paper cup. The second snack was half frozen, the lady sitting next to me opened her croissant revealing cheese which had mould on it! Am now trying to get a refund of our upgrade fees - which on the website statess that if unavailable would be refunded not more than 5 days after the flight. This would appear to be a fantasy!

In our way back to Spain we also arrived late. But not only this, we bought our flight in February for our trip in April and they did not have on mind the change of time that is done in the landing country (Spain in this case). Therefore, we bought the ticket with a landing time of 20h20 (winter time) and the flight real time was 21:21 (summer time) but we end up landing way later than this. Due to this silly error, half of the plane had conecting flights to different parts of Spain, which we all lost.

Plus flight attendants were not helpful at all.

Having said this, flights are old and the audio of many seats doesn't work which is quite anoying when you have 9 hours flight and you have paid 700€.

Because the planes are so old, there was no padding left on my seat and I could not get comfortable- things were broken-- like my media. Nothing was working at my seat the entire return flight-- 15 hours just sitting there uncomfortably AND the absolute worst part of all? Plane was filthy! I am still sick after a month of returning from dirty bathrooms and my dirty broken seat. The bathrooms one by one started not working until there was only 1 working for the entire plane. Are you kidding me? You know everyone had stomach issues coming back from India.... and the coffee or tea from the flight. (Don't drink the coffee on the flight. The water is not good.) And my last tip, If you are going to complain- you must do it right at the airport which I didn't do- so sorry- this is karmic retribution. Maybe the flight on Air India is cheaper, but not worth a seat whatever you pay. There are many other newer planes that fly to India."

The seats have good leg room but when the person in front puts their seat back it tilts too far and it’s most uncomfortable. My concern about the flight was the level of safety. There didn’t seem to be any concern about luggage being stowed away and it didn’t seem to be a problem having luggage at your feet.
Soft Drinks were left at the back of the plane to help yourself. Unfortunately (or fortunately for some) Ballantine whiskey was left out as well and the gentleman sitting in front of my husband took advantage of this and became increasingly drunk and proved to be a nuisance to us.
When descending into Mumbai airport the toilets remained available and people were freely allowed to use the toilets although the seat belt signs were on. There were no flight attendants visible.
On our return from Mumbai to London we were boarded more than one hour before departure. At departure time we were told we would have to wait for 24 passengers so we sat for another 1 hour without water or A/C. So we sat for two hours before our 9 hour flight.
Once again when descending to London Heathrow passengers were allowed to continue to use the toilets. I remarked to my husband wouldn’t it be funny if at some time passengers were in the toilets on landing. Lo and behold as we landed (a very hard landing) two passengers emerged from the back (just a few rows behind us)they could only have come from the toilets. Unbelievable. Again no flight attendants were visible. As soon as the plane touched tarmac you could hear all the seat belts being unbuckled. There was no PA announcement of the dangers.
My feet were black from the foot rest. Don’t choose row 38 window seat. No window."

Each passenger had a video screen (for films and such) but my screen froze early in the flight. This was a common problem – a lot of passengers had the same experience (the same thing happened to me on the return flight, as it did to other passengers on the same flight on different days). Even worse, the individual reading light didn’t work: the light is controlled by the remote (really) which didn’t work. So prepare to entertain yourself for fourteen hours (sixteen hours coming back) – in the dark.
Another strange aspect of the flight was the disappearance of the flight attendants. As soon as we reached cruising altitude, they served us a snack. As soon as they finished with that, they served a meal. Then they disappeared. I went looking for them (several times, to get help with the reading light and remote - without success). I found one in the tail – where were the others? Juice containers had been put out so passengers could help themselves. But the area was a mess: spilt juice, trash on the deck."

I must tell you I had very low expectation of service from Air india when I decided to travel on it.

First when we went for check in there is no separate counter for passengers who had done web checkin. It seems that the people manning the check in counter are in relax mode not worrying about what passengers are facing while waiting in long queue. They do everything at very leisurely pace taking there time.

When we were at boarding get we were told to get our travel document checked we followed instruction and waited in line to get it done. The guy checked my passport and visa and started to ask purpose of my visit and similar question my question is are they Immigration officer who are they to ask the same when we were cleared by immigration. I waited for my wife to come but I saw that he was holding up my wife more than 5-8 minutes checking and again checking the visa because the visa sticker was torn but he didn't see that there was another stamp put by consulate. He started asking weird questions why are u going alone she told I am with my husband what will u do for two days in Milan how does it matter to him he was only supposed to check document not act as Immigration office he even threatened to call senior and stop my wife from boarding, I have travelled many times abroad I don't choose air india but I have not seen this kind of behaviour in any other air line no doubt why air india is loss making and losing market share.

When you board you feel you have boarded a bus not a plane the crew is indifferent as if they were put to work without their will

I was told that the baggage would be adjusted at Delhi and lounge facilities would be accorded to me. However I will have to collect my check in baggage at Delhi, go out of the airport again re-enter from the Departures side and re-check in as the two classes were different and through check in was not permitted. Regarding the refund, I was told it would be done automatically by Air India online.
Well I had to bear the discomfort of exiting the Delhi airport, re-entering Departures,, rechecking in my baggage. The excess baggage was not charged, also I was provided Lounge facilities. However at the Check In Counter, the individual gave me a centre seat and made my boarding pass as such. It was noticed by his supervisor, who asked him why he was doing that on a Business Class Ticket and then he made the change and an aisle seat was provided.

Departure from IGI Airport New Delhi was literally just straight out and approach to Changi Airport, Singapore felt like a straight in approach.

There was little turbulence encountered but what rough air existed was cleverly damped by the Boeing 787's advanced design. The plane was also very quiet, with engine sounds audible only during the takeoff run and the reverse thrust mode during landing.

The flight seemed to arrive earlier than normal thanks to some favorable winds that pushed the ground speed of the aircraft to nearly 1000kph while cruising quietly at 40,000 ft over the Indian Ocean.

This flight back to Singapore had a beverages and dinner service, both of which were good. In fact I had no shortage of liquid dinner with not one but two glasses of quality straight whiskey that lasted a very long time!

Dinner was Hindu non veg with an accompanying cucumber salad and ended with a pleasantly sweet note with two surprise gulab jamuns.

And right after dinner was the optional tea and coffee. The in-flight entertainment system had a vast amount of movies, music and games along with the ever-useful inflight map and flight data screens. It was somewhat fun to make the center aisle seats display maps and flight data all at once like a miniature cockpit.

Although this was an economy class seat it was surprisingly comfortable as the 787 has a larger than normal cabin and a very high ceiling. After such a satisfying dinner I woke to the aircraft slowly descending over Singapore en route to landing."

As I was going through the various flight timings, Air India seemed the best with an 8.30 pm flight giving us the complete day in the city. Another plus was the aircraft flown on this route, the Dream liner. Had to experience it.
During the initial booking, I had blocked seats for the family, so we are all seated together. On the day of the flight(1st April 2018), completed the online checking to save time at the airport. However to my horror, I noticed all the seats had been re allocated and we were all seated in different seats quite apart from each other.
On calling the customer care, I was informed that from today (1st April), the seats are chargeable and as such the allocation was done by the system. The agent requested me to reach the airport and airport staff will assist in seating us together.
Once we reached the airport, I requested the counter staff of my issue, she was very polite and assured me of sorting the issue. And she did manage to have us all seated in 1 row all together!!
The aircraft was also neat and clean, not the dirty and stained image portrayed by some passengers. The crowd in the aircraft was also very decent with lot of families and English speaking young Indians!!!
The hostess (Ms Patel) serving our area was very polite and efficient. The Purser on the other side was also efficient.

Over all I will say, they did good."

Beautiful plane, smooth journey and the plane met all of the expectations for a long haul airline. Where the airline needs to do better is firstly the check in process. You can check in online, print off all boarding passes and select seats etc. However when you get to the check in desk prior to you flight, I have to wait with my bags with all of the other guests who have not checked in online, when I only need to drop my bags.

The airline itself had a great aircraft, but the touch screens are really touch screens, hard presses on the screen itself, and most of the screen controls needed maintenance. For example the hand control had buttons missing, so it made using the touch screen a little laborious.

Ad lastly, the food (vegetarian option) need to be improved. While the food was tasty, I didn't really fancy having lentils and roti (Indian bread) for breakfast in the morning,

The safety instructions, which are normally given during the taxiing of the aircraft, were given during and after the take off! The pilots usually speak to the passengers, informing them about the cabin crew and the languages the crew can communicate in; here, there was no such thing. In fact, to my amazement, I found the pilot sharing more technical details (air speed, pressure outside, etc.) before landing. Beverages served are all non-alcoholic ones, even the vines offered to us! Cabin crew's behavior was quite okay. Baggage limit is 30kgs, I feel that's the only thing one can look up to!
If I had to compare other airlines with Air India, I would say choose Air India only in two cases: a) if you find lowest prices tickets b) if you need to carry considerable amount of luggage*

Well then at the airport because they use alliance air and alliance air allows for 15kg and not 25, they then charge you a hefty fee for baggage overage that it takes twenty minutes or more for them to process while you’re worrying about missing your flight just to get ripped off.
It’s the only airline I’ve ever used as a world traveller that has found that practice acceptable.
Then to top it all off, I hadn’t used my credit card he entire month in India, but had to because the amount the wanted to charge me was beyond what I had left in my pocket, and immediately afterwards I start getting fraudulent charges on my credit card. I’m still travelling, so now I have to cancel my card without having a place to send a new one to.

A passenger was not well , the plane was taken back and the passenger was take off along with his luggage, this took over 2 , while this was happening we were given water to drink . I decided to have a drink of my own alcohol a single whiskey shot as I was traveling alone and was very tired from my long journey I was carrying small 1/2 bottle of , which I did not hide and opened and pured in the cup given by the staff and drank it over the next 10 minutes. I was not disturbing any one and quietly watching Tv .20 minutes later I was confident by her leader who was very loud asking I was drinking I said yes I have had I drink about 20 minutes ago. This is where it all went wrong she tried to make a big scene out of it saying I should not be drinking my own alcohol and I will be fined for this as soon as I get to Birmingham. I said I'm sorry I did not know I did pured this right in font of you Staff who did not mention anything then why now ?she was very loud rude and call the captain while the was happening passengers around me who Were not known to me were saying how rude she was and I have done nothing wrong Captain came we both spoke in a polite manner When I explained to him and showed him the small bottle he said it's fine and left
After that the look on her face and service was unbelievable to extent that I asked for a coffee when the were serving to all I was totally ignored 2 requests was also same say there's one on it's way but nothing came
I can understand people get drunk and cause problems , but not all customer are the same
I do travel a lot on panes and different airlines never have had been in a situation like this . As we landed Birmingham nothing was said and no fine given to me
If she was well trained in her job all this should have been expressed kindly just like the captain did

Asking for a glass of water, from the look on the female flight attendants faces it’s as if your asked them if you can take their daughter to bed. They REALLY are that bad. On a 7 hour flight the majority of the stewardesses simply choose to sleep behind a curtain! Only reason I flew them was for the sake of convenience. Next time I’ll put up with stopping off at Dubai and will choose Emirates or anyone else just not these numpties.

I travelled by Air India - Alliance Air Flight No. 9551 from Chennai to Madurai on 25/3/18.

The baggage scan was done quickly. However the loading staff at the scan machine were casually dressed in their own clothes, wearing slippers. You normally expect airline staff to be prim and proper, whether loaders or pilots!!! Air India-Alliance Air should look into this.

Nothing amiss at the check-in counter.

The flight was on schedule, took off at 2.45 pm and landed at 4.10 pm.

It’s an unduly long, slow flight for a very short route, primarily because of the aircraft they use, the ones with the propellers. I think they call them the Turboprops. This aircraft, I came to know from the safety literature, is called ATR 72 600.

The advantages of flying in such aircraft are that you fly at fairly low altitudes and so get to see the countryside scenery below and you fly through the clouds which is an exhilarating feeling by itself.

The disadvantages are the extended flying hours; the aircrafts are smaller, lower in height and appear claustrophobic; the unstable feeling you get during take off, landing or during turbulence. But actually, they are pretty safe aircraft.

The safety procedures were handled competently by the lone Air Hostess. The announcements in Hindi were probably OK (I know a smattering of Hindi). But the male Purser’s English announcements were atrocious and I couldn’t make out what he was trying to say.

I should point out that this particular plane I travelled on was very nice, probably new, clean, well maintained, with good seat covers, with everything working. In fact, there was nothing I could complain about in the aircraft.

They served Vegetable Sandwiches and a small bottle of water for all passengers. I have not been able to understand this : I travel very regularly on this route, on all the no-frills airlines and sometimes they serve refreshments and most times they don’t. Unless, of course, you buy from them on board. The Veg Sandwiches were good. The food service and garbage clearance was done quickly and matter-of-factly.

On landing at Madurai, the Air India bus which took us to the terminal, was not air-conditioned and had very little seating. It was more a “standing” bus. A tad inconvenient for the elderly. The baggage claim took longer than usual. I guess this is one area they could look into and improve the turnaround time.

Overall a nice flight."

Seat space was minimal, the in-flight entertainment basic and inaudible and the cabin crew remote, unfriendly and disinterested. The only time we saw the crew apart from embarkation and disembarkation was when they swiftly 'frisbee'd' our meals out to us. Never saw them again until the 3 hr sector was done despite the fact that I'd accidentally put on my call light for the last 2 hours!! The only mitigating factor is that they were cheap and the trip was short, but I'd hate to do a long sector with them. Oh! And I almost forgot - the check-in process at Delhi was diabolical. It took over an hour to traverse a queue that was only 20 people deep. Give yourself plenty of time!!"

Flight delays do happen however the service you receive throughout the waiting and post boarding the flight has to be given utmost priority knowing that travellers would be annoyed!! Once we board the flight, many people who were traveling together were allowed to sit wherever they wanted so there was no discipline. Musical chair was played I guess 🤨 When the refreshments are served, Upma looked like the one you get at municipal hospital 👎🏻 plastic spoon that was suppose to be used to stir the coffee had extra plastic ends. Chances of risking it in hot water might drop it in tea or coffee you drinking .. Whilst serving the crew boys slipped and dropped stuff and were annoyed with the flight and crowd itself !! They kept making faces to do their job!! I have written to Air India the same feedback. Not sure how much they would work upon !!"

Flying in economy back to USA was horrible! I booked 2 tickets for my girlfriend and I. The website online check-in didn't work, so we had to get boarding passes at the gate - I complained that our tickets were not together, the AI employee waved me dismissively off saying only 'full flight'. We both were in middle seats, not near each other for 14 hours!! We got to airport 3 hours in advance, so because their website didn't work - and a rude employee - we had to spend the entire flight back not able to even see each other, due to where we were sitting.

With a travel time of 15.5 -16 hrs this is the best and the only direct flight in this sector. Since this is the only direct flight from Delhi to SFO, the flight is always fully booked. Especially if you are looking for tarvelling on monday night book well in advance as chances are that the flight may be fully sold out.
1. Check-in: As always i did a web check-in which was smooth and quick. The staff at the airline counter for baggage drop and boarding pass collection was helpful.
2. Flight Timings: the flight departs at 4 am from Delhi and it's arrival time is 6am SFO time. Both times that I flew, the flight wwas on time. Arriving at 6am also means that one is through with immigrtaion etc at SFO max by 8- 8:30 am leaving you sufficient time to start your day.
3. In flight entertainment system: both times i found that inflight system doesnot work for 5-6 seats and you are told of this only when you are boarding the flight. since the fligt is a long one, travel without inflight system is not easy especially if you are travelling alone. The collection of bollywood movies is decent.
4. Service and meals: the service level is ok. Food is good. the younger cabin crew in economy class is friendly and courteous. They are happy to serve you. I particularly prefer walking down to the crew and ask them if i need anything. This is a quiccker way to get good service. Calling the crew from seat involves long wait times and you can expect service only after presseing the call buttin 2-3 times.
5. Seating and interiors: the seats are spacious and comfortable though they have a dated look. Not very clean too. Same is the case with Toilets. expect at least 1 toilet to get blocked during the flight.
overall a value for money, no frills flight."

Our connecting flight was 2.15 pm to Kolkata, we missed the flight and we were directed to collect our checked in baggage to go to security check and customs clearance. It was a sheer chaos. We were all tired. There were passengers connecting to Goa, Bangaluru, and other parts of the country. We all missed the flights and waited for our luggage until 5.05 pm.
What a hassle we left with our own and taking the trolly full of luggage and headed for domestic section of the airport, a long Q waiting for us.

Given this early hour and the rush, it was normal to reach the airport 1.5 hours in advance and I reached the gate at about 3.55 am. As I walked in, there were the International Flight counters on my right and the Domestic ones to the left. I went and stood in the serpentine line of the domestic one.( Even though I had a web check-in, my boarding pass needed to be reissued as per the printed instructions ) After about 15 minutes a lady announced that the Ahmedabad Boarding passes would be issued by the International Counter ( even though my flight was completely domestic and wasnt proceeding to any international destination from Ahmedabad. In fact it was returning to Mumbai ). I then changed to the other side and spent another 40 minutes in another long queue. The problem was exacerbated due to the casual attitude of the counter staff who were grossly inefficient in the time taken for issuing the boarding passes. They were interested in casual conversations with the other staff milling about and it definitely affected the productivity. ...Finaaallllyyyyy I got my boarding pass after nearly an hour in the airport. From there I decided to rush straight to the gate ( since all this casual & unorganised attitude had resulted in me being left with no time to hop into a lounge for a coffee ).
If you think the ordeal was over then wait...you are still in for a surprise.
I was supposed to board the flight from Gate 77 ...After reaching the gate ( about 1.25 Kms away ), a staff standing there was coolly announcing that the gate has been changed to Gate 44 ( again about 1 km away in a different direction ). ..WTF !!!
Even though it's a Silent Airport ( meaning there are no PA announcements ), what stops you in sending SMSes to the travellers which would save them a trek of nearly 2 Kms at 5 am ! There was a group of about 27 ladies which had a few elderly ones also..Can you imagine ther plight !

The airports consistently do not allow you to enter the airport from another flight and transfer inside security. So...you have to exit security, baggage included, and then wait until you can recheck in to your next location. That means you cannot have access to the airline lounge that you have earned the privilege of using in stops or layovers. Additionally, Indian Air food is usually only a vegetarian menu and is poorly prepared. You can get where you are going but you are tired and hungry when you get there. Also, unless you are in first class seats, you will be crowded. The seats are very small, with little legroom, and with Indian culture not understanding comfortable body contact, you will likely be uncomfortable."

The positives: Air India uses the international terminal from Kochi, which is far better and comfortable than the domestic terminal.
The flight was on-time and I had blocked a seat on the first row in economy. The seats on the A319 were spacious and super comfotable. The food was quite tasty and generous for a 1.5 hour flight. The crew was polite and helpful.

The negatives:
The staff did not offer any choice of meal just served vegetarian food.
The flight lands at the international terminal in Mumbai for some reason and right at the peak hour so getting through the idiotic bureaucratic checking at Mumbai airport - You skip the immigration counter but there is someone checking that your passport is stamped after you exit immigration (which is a dumb practice followed in no other country I have visited and then again get stuck into the customs line.

So its not the airline fault per se... but convenience wise, it does add 15-20 min at the minimum to your airport exit time."

There are reasons to doubt about the food quality check by Air India and the underplay in getting such substandard product approved and serve the toxins in plates of innocent passengers and play with their health!
Appears a silent loot of public health!!

Lounge was fine, boarding ok- when I sat down on the plane they offered some kind of juice and I asked for a drink. They replied the bar had not yet been turned over to them. They did bring a drink after reaching cruising altitude, which is also when they turned on the inflight entertainment. So we lost 30 minutes of movie time on a rather short flight. I was given a menu with some offerings-Indian, Indian or Indian. I fly a lot of Asian airlines and there is always a Western dish but not here.
The seat was comfortable, I did notice on take off they did not make a passenger who was asleep put his chair back to position, they just took off with him laying down. The amenities were not stocked and I had to ask for the booties.The service was ok, had the 2 most senior attendants I have ever had running biz class. My next flight will be with Emirates and I look forward to the comparison. AI was not awful or bad, just boring and a general ""don't care"" feel."

And even as I kept reading about the losses it incurs, I could not ever be disenchanted, at least till date, by its efficiency where it counts the most, the skill of the pilot. As they say, the take-off, the landing, and the turbulence up in the sky are the three tests, and in my experience the pilots of the public sector airlines have always handled it the best. And this time was no exception, I never knew when I touched base.
Om the flipside, I lost count of at how many points I had to show my boarding pass and the ID till I was airborne. If it was for security purposes I would have been fine, but why only Air India? I did not have to face the same when I recently flew on another one.
Finally it was a dinner flight, and perhaps I was more exhausted and sleepy than hungry, and hence did not find the rice (with paneer in it) and dal meal (though served hot) appetising enough and just had a bit of it. However the piece of bread that they served (to have with butter) should have been fresher. It looked stale and when I tore a bit of it and tasted it my apprehension was not negated. The croissant served on an early morning Vistara flight from Pune to Kolkata could be something Air India might want what it served to be replaced with.
But again, the touch down will still make me opt for an AI flight, no matter how the rest of the services offered are."

In the flight, the handle of the seat was dismantled and my grand-daughter sitting on this seat just escaped unhurt. When the handle came out of the seat, I pressed the call bell, the light was on but no attendant came to attend us for 15 min. When one air hostess was just passing through I asked her if she is not supposed to see the signal which is lit for 15 min?. She asked what is the problem. I showed her the handle, but she was not apologetic at all rather no expression, and she just said, I will see, but no one came again to us, either to put the tape or something like that to make it safe to the child.

Which said I have to contact the airport to ""decheck"" myself because I'd checked in online - literally, the instructions were to ""go to the AirIndia website and look up the number of the ticket desk at Heathrow."" They didn't even have the damn phone number on hand. So I do that, and no one at the airport picks up except the ATC (albeit annoyed), which says to call the same customer service line. So I call this customer service line back, again, and they say that I have to physically go to the airport... to uncheck myself in... so that I can call them back and book a flight that will actually fly. And this is all for a flight-change/refund that's legally required for them in the first place. Wish I could tell you how it pans out in the end.

This is the return of a round trip - the flight out was fine. I was actually quite happy with it. But it's nowhere near worth it if this is what happens when something goes wrong. Save yourself the hassle, though. I'll bet budget airlines have their admin better together."

The flight took off on time and landed as scheduled the last three times I have flown it.
While the interior decor of the First Class cabin does not even begin to compete with those of other International airlines, the in-flight service was without blemish. The service providers (flight attendants) were polite, courteous, welcoming, engaging. The service itself was outstanding. Food quality was excellent and was on-demand. I understand that is quite standard in the First Class cabin. The entertainment left a lot to be desired. The movie selection in the ""new movies"" section was dated and the navigation was quite spotty. Overall I would commend Air India on a greatly improved service. For me, take and landing on International flights is of paramount importance.
I do have two issues with the airline. 1) Does not work with TSA and does not offer TSA Pre-Check facility. 2) Even though it is a part of the Star Alliance, its partner United Airlines always gives me grief about checking baggage all the way to its destination,when flying out of the country. On return to USA, Air India checks the baggage in all the way to the destination without a problem. Perhaps it is a problem with United Airlines rather than Air India, but it does impact negatively on passenger experience."

I had pre ordered a bland meal... they forgot... I starved for the duration.
I paid extra for an exit seat 11c only to find 4 of the buttons on my remote missing so every time I needed the volume up or down, the crew had t come and stab it with a knife!
The crew were not interested in serving after the meal, if you wanted anything you had t go get it yourself, the crew could be found sleeping in “business/ first class” which is just a seat with a box to put your feet on!

Sadly, the experience I had with Air India on this latest trip proved last time was not a one off. If anything, this flight was even worse than the last one!

Things started off with their mobile phone app not recognizing my booking reference, however, when I logged in to the website on my laptop the same reference worked fine.

The flight was delayed by an hour, but that's not necessarily the airline's fault. However, when we did start to board the boarding process was a shambles. A very officious Air India rep barking that he wants to see my visa but then turning his back on me to deal with a family who clearly have no appreciation of the concept of a queue. He then walks off without dealing with me, so I just carried on queuing to board. Ironically this same officious gentleman then appeared at the desk before the ramp and barked at me again saying why hasn't my visa been checked? ...I replied ""well, you asked to but you walked off without doing it and nobody else was there"". No apology, just a grunted response.

I then boarded the plane, a 787 Dreamliner. For such a new aircraft I was shocked at the state of it. The seats looked really grubby and in need of a clean. The aircraft smelt awful and obviously hadn't been cleaned properly after the incoming flight as there was still litter on the floor. My in-flight entertainment system crashed after about 1 hour of the flight and the supplied headphones were damaged, only functioning through one ear. The USB charging port for my seat was also broken. The reading light also continuously turned itself off every minute or so.

The cabin crew clearly need to attend charm school and they insist on you putting your seat up when they serve the ""food"" whether you want to eat or not. I appreciate this is a courtesy for the passenger behind but, if they spaced their seats a little more generously, like some other airlines, this would not be necessary. Obviously this 'policy' makes it impossible to get any rest without interruption (a big problem if you're travelling on business and your firm can't afford business class). If you do choose to eat the food is truly horrible and don't get me started on the state of the toilets.

9 hours of my life I'll never get back. Regrettably I've got to fly back to London with them but, after that, I'll never fly with this excuse of an airline again."

At the airport you deal with self service check in machines that also didn't work well and then queue and wait to check in and get your bag labels.
The plane was a little ragged at the edges, my carpet under the seat had come loose, the screen didn't work very efficiently (the touch function didn't work at all) and the recline of the seat mechanism wasn't very positive and moved as you shifted in your seat. The food on board was generally OK and service was functional if a little remote. The worst thing was that on the return leg a toilet had been badly soiled by passengers and was stomach churningly awful. Not something the airline can do much about I suspect.

It feels secure having your bags go through security. I did not mind that they asked me about my contents. I was happy they were so attentive. One of the employees actually walked me over to the correct line up so I knew where to go. The customer service reps were kind patient and smiling.

The flight although short we were served a snack and juice.

The cabin crew's behaviour was not at all professional and they did the bare minimum. Flight wise, everything was fine until we started our descent into Bangalore. The descent was not all all smooth and I thought we are having some technical difficulties. Many of us in the flight felt nauseous and a couple of passengers even threw-up. The landing was another scare, the aircraft jumped twice before it finally settled to land.
I reckon it was sheer lack of experience or negligence which led to a terrible experience for all of us."

There was no information at the airport and a Sikh gentleman expressed the opinion that it was a shambles. ""Where are yo fro?"" I asked. Portsmouth mate! At last we ascertained that the flight had been delayed half an hour and we boarded safely. Getting to Delhi I was ushered right across to my Guwahati flight and arrived on time.

In February I went to sign into my Air India account and to my surprise I saw that my booking had been cancelled. I called customer service to enquire what was going on and a very irate member of their team told me that there was a problem with my payment method so I had to go on the website and book my flight again. I demanded to know why I wasn’t notified that there had been a problem with the payment, especially considering that I had a booking confirmation page and confirmation number. The person was very abrupt and spoke to me as if I was an imbecile and told me it’s not their problem and that I just need to go book again. I explained that I if I book now, the price would have hiked as it would be deemed a “last minute” booking and which is why I made sure to book early from last year. He couldn’t understand my point and kept saying I would get a cheap ticket online. I explained that this was my first time using Air India, and I am a frequent flyer with Virgin/ BA and Emirates and my experience thus far has not been great with Air India. He was not bothered with any niceties to persuade me to continue talking to him. So I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager.

After being left on hold for about 40minutes, another person answered my call and explained that my booking had been cancelled because I had requested a meal when booking online(!) Apparently their systems cannot cope with such complexities He asked that I book again online but not to request a meal or put in my membership number, as this will lead to an “error” on their system. Apparently I should input such details after my booking has been made. 🙈

I found this beyond ridiculous. How can I trust a company to fly me into the air if their online system cannot cope with a meal request?! I then asked if I could make my booking over the phone with him. He said they can perhaps take the booking details but in order to pay, I would have to physically visit their offices in person! How antiquated! Beyond ridiculous. So I said I would book my ticket online myself. I checked online and mercifully the price had not increased that much for my now “last minute flight”. I found a ticket for $460... But I had no faith in Air India to give me a decent in-flight experience if this was just the hassle of booking... so I booked with Virgin for $640!

Better to pay extra and be safe than sorry I think.

Air India need to invest in better booking systems and invest in training their staff to be more helpful."

I had nothing but problems from the start from checking with their self checking machine with dispensed the boarding pass but no tags for the bags. So approached one of the staff by the machine who fobbed us to being given two separate seats on the connecting flights. Inflight attendants failing to respond to pasengers calling, had ordered a fruit platter and given a veg meal instead.
Thought this was it but it continued to our connecting flight being delayed and no info available.
On trying to checkin online for our return flight, their website kept on malfunctioning and had to give up. Upon checking in at Rajkot for the return flight again given separete seats. To rub it in our flight again got delayed and ended up waiting 4 hours and again no info. Upon getting to Delhi again our flight got delayed to London.
Overall we had nothing but delays and no info or any apologies. I won’t fly with Air India again even if they offered me a free flight. They need to get their act together."

Even for our coming Kolkata-Delhi-Amritsar and back to Kolkata via Delhi including Shimla Delhi trip,I have booked seats in Air India.My next one from Kolkata to Bhubaneswar and back is also by Air India during Ratha Jatra.

But most humiliating part was when I saw that Sr Citizens are being deprived of availing the concessional rate .

For quite sometime , while booking tickets ,I was seeing that the concessional rate for Sr Citizen is very high than the cost of flight tickets of Air India in general category. To enquire this I had been
to Air India Kolkata office on this 10th January and there also it was conveyed that the rate of concessional tickets for Sr Citizen is higher than general tickets and the lady suggested to buy normal ticket .

Later I checked the price of flight ticket rate for general category, sr citizen concessional and War widow concessional for one side journey from Kolkata to Delhi for 22-1-2018 which showed as under:

Flight No : AI 021
Kolkata (10.00) to Delhi(12.05)
22-1-2018

General : Rs.4195 oneway
War Widow : Rs.3806 oneway( concessional rate)
Sr. Citizen : Rs.7822 oneway ( concessional rate)

What type of concession Air India is offering to Sr. Citizens ? If Air India decides not to give any concession to Sr. Citizen they should tell straight please. Otherwise, any Sr citizen may buy a concessional ticket at a higher price than normal rate and this may incur financial loss. This is utterly himiliation to oldies.

Our Air India flight from Jaipur to Mumbai landed on time at 15.50, but we did not disembark the aircraft till 16.15, which was a bit of a worry as our connecting flight to Goa was scheduled to depart at 16.30.

Air India ground crew staff took us and 4 other fellow passengers by bus to the aircraft bound for Goa, which we boarded straight away. We should not have worried about missing the flight as it was not airborne until 17.40

The reason given for the delay was due to works been undertaken on a runway and that necessitated closing one runway down and opening another. Think our departure slot was missed as we were waiting for transfer passengers from another flight on to this one and then the runway change over happened.

We sat on the tarmac, aboard the aircraft for about 75 minutes and were not offered a glass of water or anything.

During the flight a snack was served, which was not very nice, a tiny, alnost finger sized, cucumber & tomato sandwich, carton of juice and small bottle of water.

We were scheduled to land at 18.00 but we landed at 18.25, which was 25 minutes later.

The leg room was good, seats comfortable and the cabin was clean. It was a bit bumpy on descent and on landing.

We were due to depart at 16.30 and arrive at 18.00, that was 1 hour and 30 minutes, the reality is it was only 45 minutes flying time. Although we were an hour and 10 minutes late in departing the late arrival time was only 25 minutes late. Airline scheduling of flights allows for delays but this was ridiculous."

1. Though this was a domestic flight, one has to catch it in the international terminal and I spent 20 minutes in the domestic security line only to be turned away to join the international line. If your boarding pass says D then you go to international and no one tells you this...

2. The flight was one hour late. No announcements, no apologies, nothing...

3. This flight stops in Kochi in the way to Trivandrum so it is quite inconvenient. The flight becomes a heavily guarded affair with guards and personnel checking your boarding pass every few minutes. Too much work for a domestic flight and very unpleasant.

4. The plane was filthy. The safety belt was black with grease and dirt. I stopped flying with air India for this reason and they haven’t changed or cleaned their planes in 10 years!

The check in counter is too slow. If you stay in abu dhabi better go to city terminal and check-in before hand. Do not forget to get the emergency exit seat here. After the check in you will reach the gate. The seats will be OK for the money we paid. There is a head rest which bends giving an amazing comfort. The food is not bad. They give puff etc. If left they will give an extra foo. Overall it is a good airlines

Flight lands at Domestic Terminal in Mumbai however since flight takes-off from International Terminal from Delhi, passengers are transferred to International by taking too much of time from one end to other end of terminal.

Luggage Belt states timing of arrival of luggage on belt but there is no luggage and I had to wait for more than an hour to clear my luggage of belt.

Flight got pretty delayed with reasons stating heavy congestion at Mumbai Airport and even delays 10 minutes of specified ground touching time.

Never have I seen a flight steward in my world travels wearing slippers. 8 hours through the 16 hour flight, 2 bagful of garbage were in the food galley. Trash all over the plane. Bathrooms are at a disarray and no seat covers. No one seems to clean anything here to care and make sure passengers are provided for.
I have been on older planes before but the staff has been courteous, willing to help and have kept the plane especially the bathrooms clean and supplies are replenished. Oh before I forgot, the TV was not working inspite of the fact that I have tried my best to go to movies over and over, I asked for help and the staff look at me as if I was stupid and went to the motion of placing the movie of Hindi language and so on and left. Who knew you have to go to Hindi before you go to English?
This plane needs some customer service training, quality control and someone needs to audit what the staff are doing since the plane is unsatisfactory to say the least. I told my husband that this plane is a prelude to India without the cows. Does it take a lot of effort for the staff to smile, say please, clean and replenish bathrooms, place trash in the right place where passengers cannot see, clean where and when needed, be professional over all in your treating passengers and in dressing up?"

This meant that the choice was either a 35 hour flight with 3 stopovers or moving it to a day earlier. Which after a 45 minute call on confirming the details were still the same and the passenger was still the same, the date was just different. They then booked my on a flight 11 months later, instead of on the day that I had requested. Not noticing this myself, arrived at the airport and was not allowed in. Phoned Air India and after much begging someone came to the terminal and after 45 minutes of me stressing, let me into the airport, still didn't confirm if I was able to fly or not, made me write a letter admitting it was my fault (not their call centre's) to be allowed on the flight.

We arrived at the Main Concourse which is accessible from the main road. Our flight was ""domestic leg of international flight"" so we did some sort of immigration (only stamping on our boarding passes) then passed through security and then reached boarding gate 20.
Flight was delayed by 20 mins.

In case you still want more then you can certainly avail that by paying. It also offers you free meal/snacks.
Particular to this flight:
1. This flight will always be delayed as it comes Internationally and goes domestically ahead. So, there is a custom duty check off the international passengers who have to go ahead which might take a lot of time(no estimation 10mins - 3hrs or more).
2. Goa Airport is really not a very good airport, having no good lounges. Security entering time bandwidth is very less in-case you reach a lot early then your flight, they might not allow you to enter. Apart from that check-in counters also don't take your check-in luggage until 3hours before your flight departure time which is not the case on other airports/flights."

There are two flights a day from Delhi and vice Versa. Please be patient if there is a delay since weather rapidly changes in the mountains and since the runaway is a visual approach the aircraft needs 5000 metres visibility to make an approach. Since it’s a atr-72 seater there are load restrictions so please be sure that your checked luggage does not weigh more than 15 kgs. Cabin baggage needs to compact because the overhead bins are smaller than an airbus. The plane boards from a far off gate and hey take you in a bus so be at the gate atleast 45 mins ahead of time. In case the flight gets delayed particularly on this sector your alternate flight arrangements would be looked after well. The staff at Dharamshala is exceptional and willing to help. The downside is the food which is low quality and potential could get you sick. He pilots never get on the PA and talk to you about the valley which to me seems very arrogant.

AIr India should improve on food part. 2 flight stwewards, young. The one doing the announcements, English was not that good, so as Hindi accents were not pure. Anyways nothing much can be expected. No tea or coffee was given, but it was given to one VIP (may be from politics) seating in first row. Ground staff at Bikaner airport changed my seat saying that there is a small group and they need to sit together."

This ticket was over £300 one way for a 1 hour in the air flight, booked 2 months ahead.

Unsurprisingly at these prices, business class was empty until the door shut, and then a couple of people were moved up. Seats looked old and dirty. The toilet was very scuffed and dirty. Otherwise everything was fine. On time, edible food, nice staff."

On our first flight from Delhi to Kullu on 25/12/17 we were denied check-in and boarding passes despite the info boards still showing check in as ‘Open’. We spoke to the Manager who looked at the computer and refused to assist us. We were told we were too late and forfeited our tickets. We went to the Air India Sales Desk who confirmed our tickets had been forfeited by us not being allowed to check in and we must repurchase new tickets for the next day.
Not wanting to stay in Delhi and given there weren’t 3 tickets available to Kullu through another airline, we reluctantly booked to fly to Amritsar. The flight was late leaving and was very average.

We already had purchased tickets through Air India to fly from Amritsar to Kathmandu via Delhi on 2/1/18. This flight from Amritsar was delayed due to visibility so after waiting for several hours for some info, we were transferred to another flight and advised when we got to Delhi there would be tickets waiting for us at the Transfer Desk for our flight to Kathmandu on a later flight. When we got to Delhi, the Transfer Desk didn’t have any tickets and told us to go to the Jetspice counter who had 3 tickets waiting for us. This required us to exit the airport and re-enter through departures. As our booked flight had already left, we were denied entry to departures at 3 separate gates. We eventually got into the ticket sales area and was advised at Jetspice they didn’t have tickets for us. We went to Air India and after a very long wait to be served were told we had to wait until the next day. After some discussion we were told our options were to go with Jetspice but it was possible the flight would be cancelled and we’d lose our money or alternatively to take the Air India flight the next day and they’d provide us with a hotel in the AreoCity. We went for the second option and eventually completed the paperwork and were taken to Shanty Palace Hotel. We had dinner at the hotel and my husband and daughter ended up with food poisoning. We left the next day for Kathmandu where they both spent 3 days in bed.

The whole experience of flying with Air India was stressful, the staff were unhelpful and we will never use them again or recommend them. I will be contacting Air India directly about its service."

Ticket number - 0985778057844
AI 173
Date 16th Dec

My family from India travel in AirINDIA 6-8 times a year from Inida-USA. This was my 1st trip in AirIndia with my infant. I had requested for a bassinet seat and i was promised and assured a seat when i called the call center and upon asking for confirmation i was told that there is no form of confirmation that can be given but it will be available. But on the day of travel i was told in Pune that there is no bassinet reserved in my name and i can request in Delhi. After arriving at Delhi, at every stage i talked to AirIndia representative and they denied saying no bassinet seat was available. But when again i called call center they said its reserved and the system is not updated. I again told at Delhi counter and again they said not a single one was available again i called customer care and asked for seat number and they said 17J, but again at counter they said its a paid seat and someone has paid extra. I was furious with my infant after so many to and fro with my kid crying. Then suddenly they agreed to give me 17J and later i found the person earlier assigned the seat and asked her if she paid extra and she denied and other than that there were multiple bassinet seat which were not used for infants and were lying vacant. Not sure why i was harassed like this for no reason at all. Not sure why there was so much mismatch in customer care and in flight staff information sharing. The people in counter kept saying flight is full and not a single seat was vacant but there were many available seats in flight. Why they didnt have accurate information at all?Other than that at Pune counter i was carrying less luggage than permitted but one of my bag was slight overweight. I was carrying just one bag instead of 2 with 1-2 kg extra which was 21kg less than what was permitted but still i was asked to adjust stuffs among bags and everytime i had to reseal and rescan. There were no help at counter and the lady at counter was very rude and indecent to deal with. I had to shuffle multiple times to fit in the 1.5 kg though i was already carrying a 23kg less bag.

Also while coming from USA-India i had booked a separate ticket for my infant and requested for a infant meal but in flight i was not given any kid meal and when i asked for normal meal as i had booked a ticket the person asked me “What will the kid eat in a normal meal”. This is absolutely ridiculous, when u cant provide kid meal and i want to get a normal meal from which i could feed only rice atleast , this type of qn is very unprofessional and annoying and rude.

Not to mention about entertainment system , lights not working and unclean bathroom.

I really had the worst experience ever with the air hostess service and staff services if at all i ignore other issues.
Its not at all kids friendly and people friendly, and in the name of direct flight its just looting people without any service."

She also came to the tarmac and was heard saying that the passengers should not be allowed to board..dunno why. As a result we were asked to wait for some minutes in the rain before we got the attendant to understand that we were getting drenched and needed to board the flight.

Surprisingly when the in flight air hostess was asked who the lady was or what was the issue, she offered no inputs.

It was an Airbus A320 aircraft which operates as domestic leg of the part International flight to Dubai. Seating had business and economy options with where around 12 seats allocated for business class. Overall a non-eventful flight.

Pros:
1. Flight booking was done through the Air India website which was done without any problem
2. Seating in Economy is good with plenty of legroom to stretch
3. Food was good, nothing fancy about it. We had requested for child's meal while booking so it was provided
4. Crew was courteous and helpful
5. Smooth takeoff and landing

Cons:
1. Though the flight was within India, but it was run as an International flight so the flight originated from International terminal of Bhubaneshwar which in in simple words - pathetic. Despite having a new domestic terminal with modern facilities like food, seating etc the international departure terminal is used
2. Even though I had pre-booked my seats, while boarding passes were issued it gave incorrect seat numbers. On inquiring they said that some other booking agent had already allocated my seats which is simply not acceptable.

Overall AIr India is the last option that I prefer to fly and since there were timing restrictions so had to go for this one else would never recommend it to someone."

Our trip started with a delay of 4 hours, we understand these things happen so we were not upset by this even though it made us miss our connecting flight. The real fun came when we landed in Delhi. Our 45 minute flight left Amritsar at 6:00 pm and arrived in Delhi at 8:45 pm. We were then told to follow a person who would show us where to go. Well he left and we had to wonder around asking about 5 different people with 5 different scenarios where to go. Of course as soon as you leave departures you are not allowed back into the airport so we spent about an hour finding the actual counter we needed. Then after about 2 hours of being pushed out of line we received our connecting flight ticket for 6:20 am the next morning. Now we were handed out ticket and told to be at the check in at 4:30 am for our flight. We were there exactly at 4:30 and the check in guy said sorry this is not a ticket. It is a wait list and there are no seats. Of course the night before we were not told this.

Our original time of departure was 6:50am from Amritsar. This was delayed till 7:10am. For us this didn’t make much of a difference as it was only 20 mins later than expected for we brushed it off. By 7:30am we had finally boarded the plane, 10 mins later than the postponed departure flight however we had an understanding that certain delays are inevitable. Soon, we were notified that the flight would be further delayed due to weather conditions; it was severely foggy, a distance of 150m was required to be seen before commencing takeoff. Again understandable as this requirement was aviation law. However the events that followed was TERRIBLE and left a sour taste.

The staff showed an extreme LACK of understanding and were unable to answer ANY questions. We were sitting in the plane for 2 and a half hours before it took off at almost 10am. During this time we were unable to use the toilet, we were not offered any food or drinks nor, as previously mentioned could staff answer basic questions such as “what’s the number I can contact to query what would happen if I miss my international flight because of this delay?”. Air India would have been aware of such delays prior to passengers boarding the flight - THEN WHY commence us boarding, disabling us access to toilets and food. Having us wait at the gate instead of getting restless in a cramped flight, uncomfortable and hungry? This is basic common sense. Not to mention, a passenger and her kids knew one of the staff and were discreetly given food behind closed curtains. However this wasn’t hidden well enough, as it was very clear to many passengers including myself. Why should one passenger be comforted from their discomfort of the situation when other families and KIDS have to live through it.

I understand there are procedures to be followed and certain processes but a level of customer service must also be upheld. And all I can say is that is what this flight lacked! Very disappointed."

From the moment we stepped in side the airport it went from bad to worse. At check in although they knew the flight was already delayed by 2 hours 5 minutes nobody advised us. This meant we could not make our connecting flight in Mumbai. I went to the Air India information desk to ask for advice as our connecting flight was also with Air India. The lady told us not to worry we were being put onto the next flight in Mumbai which was around 9pm although this wasn’t great we understood that delays happen. After hours of being sat in Jaipur Airport another English couple informed us we could use our boarding card to get a free sandwich and drink which would’ve been nice if staff had told us. Although it was appreciated the quality of the sand which was great. Despite being one of the first people to check in once we get on the plane it’s like musical chairs with cabin crew moving people all over the place which caused further disruption. Upon arrival in Mumbai we was advised to go to the Air India desk.. what a joke trying to even find it or any staff member who was willing to take us to the correct place. We finally find it we are taken out of the airport and brought back in to the Air India where they had no idea of what had been said in Jaipur. Low and behold the 9pm flight was full, the lady on the desk then booked us on the next following flight which was at 0210am the following day. She gave us our tickets and advised us to go to another desk to get our boarding cards printed, and if it hadn’t been bad enough to this point it just became hell on earth. Staff dealing with too many people at once, not listening, taking your paper work from you then denying they ever had it. Some passengers were told to collect luggage we had no idea where ours was. People were stood hours without being acknowledged and even dismissed. Finally 2 hours 35 minutes after being issued a ticket we had our luggage, a boarding card and very kindly a voucher for the lounge. Good job there was no spaces on the 9pm flight because we would’ve have missed it. The lounge was incredible but unfortunately we couldn’t enjoy it due to the stress and anxiety caused by Air India staff up to this point. Our flight was scheduled for 0210am and we boarded on time and once again musical chairs began. We finally departed the airport at 0250am with no explanation as to why we had been sat on the plane for all that time. We eventually reached our holiday destination at 06am on Saturday 20th January we should’ve arrived at our holiday destination at 8pm on Friday 19th January. Due to the delays and no sleep this has resulted in us missing one day of a holiday of a life time we had saved up for. Very disappointed and angry. Would never fly with Air India again and would advice people to avoid."

Economy",Service has gone downhill,"We too the direct Air India flight from Newark, New Jersey to Mumbai as well as back in December 2017. The flight from Newark was as usual late boarding. But not a big issue since usually they make up in the flight time and reached Mumbai on time. The ground staff seemed totally untrained - one of the ground staff was screaming at an elderly lady who stepped into the business class boarding line by mistake and on other passengers complaining, the supervisor was supporting his colleague. Poor customer service!!!

More than half the TV systems did not work while going to Mumbai. Don't the airlines do a proper check of all equipments before flying or maybe economy class doesn't matter to them??

But the biggest put-off the whole trip both ways was the flight attendants as well as the food. The lady attendants especially had lots of attitude while serving food. They did not have enough non veg food in stock and they were trying to convince passengers to take veg. We tried both kinds and both were bad and tasteless. Food really seems to have gone downhill compared to from our previous flights on the same iteniary."
