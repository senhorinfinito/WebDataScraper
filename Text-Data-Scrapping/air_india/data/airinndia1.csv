BAD service, WORST food, they NEVER answer phone, when you are lucky and they answer, they keep you for more than 30 minutes on hold and then they hang out just to don't explain you what is going on...much better to take another serious airline, even if you have to wait for hours than trusting air india and be f***ed out"

I have been waiting for my refund ever since and there have been no courtesy messages sent back despite the countless number of calls and emails I have sent them.

I have heard from other friends and family that other airlines have issued refunds to them when the pandemic happened and here is our lovely airline taking their own sweet time to even respond to an email.

The agents over the phone are a bit clueless because I don't think the management has even given them the adequate steps to take when a customer is calling for a refund. They seem a bit too lost every time I speak to them. Each time they give me a different number to ring or a different email to write to.

I rarely travelled by Air India but I know this would be my last time booking a flight with them.

I am so fed up of this crap! Air India, you need a hard knock on your head :)"

They will take your money and you will never see it again, even if you do your due diligence and cancel within 24 hours, even if you call them every other day for 2 month, wait on hold for hours, write 20 emails and create 5 escalated cases with their sub standard, rude and good for nothing customer support agents.

All of the above happened to me. I booked a business class ticket and tried to cancel online but the system was down so I called to cancel within 24 hours. But the customer support agent casually said, and I quote ""please call back later. The system is undergoing maintenance and I cannot cancel at this time"". That was my first red flag. What kind of an agent cannot cancel even it the user cannot cancel?

So I left an email asking them to cancel within 24 hours.

I called several times after that and I got the same response:

1. I'd have to pay the $200 cancellation charge because the 24 hours has passed. Otherwise, they said its wise to hold off on cancelling until my escalated case would be reviewed by someone at a higher level (classic Indian bureaucracy).

2. That the customer agents do not have access to emails because they just dont and only the backend team can see my emails (this was new. I haven't heard of any other airline that keeps its phone staff and email staff separate).

3. That I'd get a response within 24 to 48 hours (but didnt). Even if I did, it was always automated or tightly scripted (was I ever talking to a human?).

Exhausted with the constant back and forth and going nowhere for a month but before my flight date, I called them to cancel my booking, agreeing to pay the $200. I was promised that my escalated case would be seen to but it never was.

I left them multiple requests in email, in consumer.com, on their feedback form but talking to these people is like talking to a wall.

If you dont believe me, please go look at airindia reviews on any website or consumer complaint websites and you'll read all the horror stories. All of them are true.

Save yourself the hassle, please book somewhere else, unless you're desperate and there are no other flights."

There isn’t enough space to write everything but here’s a summary:
- Business class has middle seats! Yes you read that right.
- much costlier than other airlines. Compared United to same journey, business class is cheaper by around $300 and they have tie ups with COVID testing sites.
- they cancel flights without letting anyone know. Only indication is retrieving your booking fails. Yep - and airline that doesn’t tell you if they cancel the flight.
- God help you if you decide to cancel - they won’t return your money. No Sir! We’ve been calling every week for 7 weeks now. Still no sign of refund. Internet has horror stories of refunds taking even longer.
- absolutely downright pathetic and rude staff.
- if you think their ground staff are bad, try their call center. Not making this up - one of the calls I couldn’t hear the guy because his internet connection was so bad and when it was okay there was a loud party going on in the background.
- couple of times I had to insist on asking for a supervisor and the response is to disconnect the line
- website is slow and too busy, looks like it’s designed by a high school kid in the 1980s
- I had a query for them - called them no less than 11 times. Different answers each time. Finally I took the best answer that said come to airport early and we’ll sort it out. Came early - they don’t even open the damn kiosk that early. Waited and waited. Finally a lady said no to the request. We said but we called and some said it was doable. She says no and walks away. That’s it. Nothing more.

This airline exists for one reason and one reason only - the Indian Govt props it up. In the open marketplace these guys would be out in a matter of days."

Thankfully, As I payed using my MasterCard, I ended up getting the refund through them. Still no response from air India.

At first they said my ticket is not confirmed so I called Air India customer service and they were like it’s all good, I should be able checkin and board. I told that to the Air India staff at the airport. So then they changed their reasoning and were like this is Vandebharat and not Air India. I don’t remember booking for Vandebharat, AirIndia made that change on their end without consulting. So I requested to do any type of accommodation but nobody at the airport or their customer service offered any kind of help. They made us run from one place to another and even thou they had office there, they were like office is not here but some place far. Then, I called United since my connecting flight was with United Airline after multiple tries, I was able get United to talk to Air India and United was able to get us a solution. Guess what? AirIndia has another flight 45 mins after this flight to same destination, they just didn’t wanted to help me out. United Airlines customer service agent was able to help us book that other flight with AirIndia and I was able to get on that flight. Thank you to customer service agent from united or else I would have had to just go back and book entirely new flight. He was kind enough to help us even thou it was an error on Airindia end.

Worst airlines ever!,"I generally don't curse anyone to the extent that I want something bad to happen to that particular individual/company/organization etc. but Air India tops in my list. I was tempted to book the non-stop flight from SFO to BLR and I booked the trip to India in April but soon it turned into a disastrous experience for me. I didn't get my RT-PCR test result on time so Air India didn't allow me to board the flight. Least they could do is put me on the next flight which typically runs half empty due as not many people prefer travelling during the pandemic. Air India was adamant about their so called policy and didn't offer to help. Customer service is so bad that the folks on the line aren't even trained enough to understand the situation. Talk to a new person you get a new perspective of their policy. I had to rebook my trip at my own expense after spending a night at a hotel. Sadly, I had no other option but take Air India that day. I board the flight and get seated and I notice the seating area hasn't been cleaned even. This is probably a time where cleanliness is at its peak and Air India just doesn't care! The infotainment doesn't work. Feels like its running on a Windows 95 OS and just struggles to boot. One can only dream of having a good time on this flight. Now I have a return flight with them and I am desperate to cancel it and needless to say Air India will introduce all sorts of fees to loot its customers even in times where there is travel ban or other pressing issues. Apparently you won't even be getting any communication once you request for refund. Why? Because Air India's ""policy"" says so!! Business is important but customers aren't. Shame on you Air India. You shall get out of this business sooner or later."

My flight from JFK was delayed because they were handing out masks, robes, and face shields. I asked what to do about my connection since I only had one hour layover and the representative said the connecting flight would wait. Once on the plane all passengers were seated in the same 10 rows without social distance while the remainder of the plane was EMPTY. I asked if I could change my seat to an empty row and the first flight attendant said NO seat changes. Luckily another flight attendant heard the interaction and secretly helped me into another seat further away from other people. The flight obviously arrived late in Delhi so I missed my connecting flight to Bengaluru. The man who helped me reprimanded me for missing my connection even though it was not my fault. I had to wait an additional 8 hours for a new flight. The airline should never have booked this series of connecting flights with a 1-hour layover.

I have contacted the airline to make a change to my ticket with the same itinerary on a different day and they booked the WRONG flight from BLR to DEL giving me another 1-hour layover at the airport. My mother, my father and myself have all called countless times to attempt to fix this so that I have a longer layover because if I miss my flight from DEL to JFK I will have to wait in Delhi for three days for the next flight to New York. That means high covid risk for me.

A customer service representative said that it would cost money to change their mistake. Another representative said that the flight from BLR to DEL is ONLY Americans flying to JFK and that the flights will wait (I’ve heard this lie before). Another representative said that they could not complete the request on the phone and to send an email instead. Three different representatives HUNG up the call. Another representative said they would not change the ticket unless the original travel agent who booked the flights called themselves to change the flight.

So I am crying from frustration and disbelief as I do not know how I will get home to the United States and I am legitimately afraid for my safety. My family is scared for me and worried because of this extreme lack of customer service help or support. The news on covid in India is terrifying. I cannot believe how hard it is to find my way home.

I am contacting my travel agent to see if they can cancel this return trip for a refund so that I can book another airline altogether.

I would give ZERO stars if I could."

The early and mid 80s were the golden years of air travel and Air India, Thomas Cook ( travel agency) formed our memories. Even then Air India was notorious for customer service ... ticketing was a time consuming process which often involved going to the ticketing office in Hyderabad and badgering the staff as they tend to be as bureaucratic as an SBI banker. No wonder the graffitti in their toilet was ""Fabulous prices, lousy service"".

Having lived in the US for almost half of my middle aged life, Air India beckoned as patriotic fervor overpowered the seeming inconvenience of a limited network and the sedate ""aged"" flight attendants ( stewardesses or air hostesses as they were know back in the day).

There was a travel ban due to COVID and I had to pick between Air India & United. I naturally opted for Air India despite it being 20% more expensive than United for a one way ticket as my return flight by British Airways was cancelled.

I tried booking with a few of my Indian debit cards which simply did not work but eventually I used my US credit card which went through but I had an error message ""Your payment has been collected, sorry we are not able to ticket your booking due to some technical reasons, we shall mail the tickets to you shortly"" ...
well I thought it was strange that I did not even have a PNR number. I called the Ar India call center and after about 15 mins , spoke to a live agent that aws able to lookup he PNR number and reassured me that it will go through and he asked me to wait for about 8 hrs since it was booked online, the ""SYSTEM"" would generate a ticket and email it. I waited the whole day and I called subsequently in the night ( 1AM) and to my dismay I could not even see the reservation. Upon waiting for anout 30 mins I got hold of an agent who calmly inormed me that my reservation was cancelled and there was no availability for a similar itinerary.

While on hold, the announcer tells my position in the queue and how long I might need to wait .. all these numbers are bogus and at best random numbers because how can one's position in the queue go from 10 to 30 and the time from 2 hours to 30 mins etc ....

I booked through United and got a cheaper fare and it was a hassle free experience like it should be ...

Why is life so hard in India?? It is companies like Air India and banks like SBI that think that the average Indian is not discerning and can be pushed around ...which is why even British Airways likes to use 30 year old aircraft without USB charging ports in their seats for their India routes unlike flights that ply between US and Europe which are more modern and have better amenities."

STAFF NAMES ARE AS FOLLOWS :
Partheeban J
PRAKASH G M
KIRAN KUMAR
These guys were mocking me, making fun of me laughing at me while I cried standing at the counter asking for help. I think they don't have their sister or mother at home so these people chose to speak with me in an inappropriate way which was disturbing. If these are the kind of services we are getting I'd request them to shut this f airline. As we don't need dogs to bark at us. They literally harassed me.. cancelled my flight three times. Made me come to airport 3 times.. in times like covid. They have no empathy for passengers.
I humbly request the appropriate authority to take stringent action against air india and the specific staff members named above."

Torn fabric of the seats, leg rest button not working, seat when done flat has a bump in the middle, only way to deal with that is to sleep on your side, no place to put personal nits and bits with the seats. Basically an economy type seat which will become flat barring some buttons not working completely. No blankets, no bedspread, no pillow, no cloth napkins. No Jazz!!

Covid 19 has been blessing for AI. This gives them good reason to do NO SERVICE. Large number of attendants do the welcome and departure with folded hands and that is the extent of the service. They huddle in the galley and never show up. If you ask for something, there is always some sort of negative attached to the response. These people have no hospitality training whatsoever. Only one meal service. No Beverage service. Meal service is in a prepackaged tray with meals likely packed a week ago. Yogurt had dry crust. No alcohol except for a one small bottle of horrible SULA wine. Cheap cheap cheap.
I bet 75% of the passengers in business and first class were non paying passengers who got upgrade by ""knowing someone"" in Air India or aviation ministry.

My suggestion: sell this behemoth to TATA or someone who knows how to do business and fire at least 80 percent of senior staff without any termination package. Completely revamp inflight service training. Send them to Oberoi or Tata for some courtesy and hospitality training before they step into an airport. Mr Amit Shah and Mr Modi Ji please do something!!.

It is disgrace that in India where you get best service in hospitality in hotels and resorts has a national airline which so dysfunctional. Disgrace to these IAS officers and secretary of ministries of aviation for doing a very lousy job."

Now, I didn't expect an emirates quality experience from their business class, but I did expect something that could be in the slightest worth some of the money we paid. The only difference between the economy class and Business was that Business so kindly welcomed us with child-like cartons of mango juice, and perhaps a bigger seat and leg space, apart from that there was nothing else I could differentiate between the two. The TV's seemed to be bizarrely covered and not able to use. Now, I appreciate the extra leg space, and the free mango juice but I do not think (in my humble opinion) its worth an extra £600.

Upon landing in New Delhi, after a long walk from the gate, process was again chaos, but manageable. Officials stamped boarding passes for those with exemptions and covid reports. Immigration was quick and smooth. Final exit had 6 counters with health officials reviewing covid reports. Upon stamp from the final counter, you may exit the arrivals area. Domestic entrance was right outside from the arrivals area, checked bags and proceeded to security, and arrived at the domestic gates.

Air India definitely does not feel like the Emirates or other better flagship carriers for the following reasons,

1. The website is really really bad. It does not work in some browsers like Firefox. The layouts are out of place. Lot of things does not even load. The information presented is not very intuitive in presentation.

2. I had to extend my flight for personal reason, and I could not do that online. I had to call Air India customer service number and for some unknown reason, every time the call used to get cut automatically once the operator puts you on hold. They said that in case call gets cut, they will call back automatically, but they don't do.

3. The inflight experience is average. I say this because some seats have broken entertainment system. Remote control does not have working buttons or in some cases missing buttons. I needed some help from the staff but the button to call inflight crew was not working.

Although it lacks in certain areas, following are some of the positive experiences,

1. The general staff is helpful and nice.

After reaching the SFO airport 3.5 hours in advance, we had to wait for 30 minutes to do a Thermal Checking to find the body temperature, which was at a random place and pretty confusing. We guided several passengers on how to get there.

After that, at the Air India counter to check in our luggage, they asked for the negative COVID-19 results. I gave them the printout I took, which said negative COVID-19 test results with ""PCR"" testing from Kaiser Permanente, which is an internationally recognized hospital. The lady at the counter was frantically searching for the word, ""RT-PCR"" and said we cannot board the flight since our document doesn't contain the word, ""RT-PCR"". We tried to reason with her but she asked us to talk to her supervisor for any queries. So, we talked to the supervisor and He said the same. The document needs to have RT-PCR and not PCR. I called my physician at Kaiser and gave the phone to him so that she could explain it in my medical terms.
My physician tried to explain that even though Kaiser does RT-PCR testing, the term used in the COVID testing in the US is PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing and it follows all the CDC guidelines. He was not even ready to listen and was repeating the same thing, He needs to have the word RT-PCR in the result document.
After that, I called Air India support, where the customer service representative was able to understand my situation and said they wanted to talk to this supervisor. The customer service representative said the COVID-19 negative test result I have is sufficient to board the flight but this supervisor said He will not accept that.

After 3 hours of trying and reasoning, we were not able to board the flight. We called customer service to cancel the ticket. They said they will charge us $100 for the cancellation fee and $200 for the no-show fee. I said we showed up but you didn't allow me to board the flight. They said they can't help it because I didn't board the flight and have to charge a no-show fee. This whole thing is a complete mess. So many people were not able to board the flight and had the same problem as us.

Advice for travelers traveling during this time:
Do get the COVID-19 test results with the word, RT-PCR in it from external labs like IGeneX or whichever travel-oriented test service at your location and reimburse the fee from your medical insurance provider."

Ms. Nikita Shinde on the Mumbai International Airport should reconsider how she approaches her staff and the customers of Air India. I will never make the mistake of flying with Air India. Ms. Nikita Shinde disregarded the advice of her supervisor and added the laptop bag’s weight onto the handbag weight. She argued and harassed me about this for 30 minutes to scare me. She wanted me to pay extra $250.00 for this. She and Air India simply wanted the money. How disgusting. AIR INDIA PLEASE INFORM YOUR EMPLOYEES OF YOUR RULES AND DONT CHARGE MONEY FOR PATHETIC SERVICE LIKE THIS. Air India should not be hiring employees that have absolutely no morals in terms of how to treat customers with respect but instead resort to demeaning body language such as rolling the eyes. Greedy employees are a staple of Air India’s service and it is horrific that Air India represents such a great nation. The supervisor agreed to let the bags go and she argued with the supervisor saying that she will not allow it under her name when her supervisor said that it is fine. To blatantly ignore and go against the supervisor and then to continue to scare the customers simply for extra money is repulsive treatment, especially during the times of the covid pandemic. One should be thinking not of profit but of compassion. It is not just a shame to have such awful employees and treatment but it is a disservice to Air India to tolerate such behavior. Proper action should be taken to rectify what happened and prevent this harassment from happening to anyone else in the future."

It’s better these type of businesses should shut down, any how they are bringing countries reputation to dust.

The Ticketing staff at Delhi Terminal 3 is worst, I don’t know if they even check their educational credentials at all before hiring.

I had to stand for 2 hours just to drop bags even after e-checking and when my turn came I was thrown here and there and charged filthy amount of Rs 20,000 just for luggage weight. I don’t Mind giving the amount if it’s the rule and is legit.

The behind desk person named Manoj Rana just in front of me let go a girl without even weighing her carry on telling her, why do you want to weight it, if you can lift it, that means it’s not that’s heavy, like seriously and the same guy charged me around Rs 600 per kg, he made me weight every luggage of myne.

I don’t mind doing that but what I saw him doing with that girl and this discrimination literally is totally unprofessional, unethical and wrong at so many levels.

I flew from US, had option of either taking Indigo or Air India, took Air India as was just feeling patriotic, never again will I fly with these unprofessional people.

Date of travel 2nd feb 2021 from Chennai airport.
Well with the covid 19 situation,landed at Chennai airport terminal 4 for the scheduled flight AI1126 to New Delhi departure 20.25 hrs,at 5.25pm. There were many flights around this time and it was all chaos.
Air India staff exercised extraordinary patience while checking all documents ,in particular,covid negative reports with all details like,passport number ,d.o.b.,test sample time etc. We wondered if we can catch the flight in time,as it took a lot of time. Rushed to the baggage scan followed by visiting the counter for boarding passes,having completed,web check in.(mobile app wasn’t allowing web check in). Immigration was well organised and a kit of visor,sanitizer and mask and ppe kit was provided at the immigration entrance.to security check.
Security check was another delay area,where due measures were in place.
The boarding gates(17) was less crowded. With hardly a few counters for a coffee or snacks,it was really difficult to get even a cup of coffee at krishna,with a coffee costing Rs190/
Boarding was comfortable.Upto Hyderabad,nothing was served in the flight. As a middle seat passenger ,ppe suit has to be worn compulsorily before boarding.
A good meal was served at about 10pm while leaving Hyderabad to Delhi
Flight landed in delhi terminal 3 arrivals by about 0.45 am 3rd feb 2021.
With flight AI 173 to SFO scheduled at 4am 3rd feb,it was a close to 2km walk(walkathon disabled) to the international transfer with a security check,to gate3B,as economy class passenger.
After waiting for quite sometime, awaiting departure,comes the announcement,that people get out and queue up for a check.
Another security check and documents check,we were given a kit if masks viser and ppe kit and headed to the aircraft Boeing 777 300ER
There was no blankets but,earphone and a snacks pack,fairly loaded with a variety of snacks.we found it ample.
Dinner(call it lunch/brunch) was served nearly 7 hrs after boarding and we found the same good.
Flight had taken off at 4.30am but landed clear 30 min ahead,by 5.30 am SFO local time.
We were provided customs declaration form to be filled and kept ready as well as covid reports for a random check by health officials
Customs (USCIS) took time as another flight AA from Delhi had landed ahead.
I was surprised that the manual system and not kiosk process was followed at SFO.
It took a near 100 min to clear through.
Air India had kept the toilets neat to begin with but we’re really wanting cleanliness after use by many.Else the airindia trip was fully enjoyable with courteous staff."

The staffs are not at all polite. They are so rude and are doing things in their on will. Not following protocols or any rules. I was flying from Cochin to Delhi then to Toronto in a Air India connection flight. The Air India staffs from Delhi did not let me fly even whwn I had a valid PCR report with me. They were so rude and they stopped me from boarding telling that they need to verify my result. The supervisor at the Delhi Airport was being so irresponsible and later was not clearly saying anything about why I'm not eligible to travel. Then he later apologized and told me he will book one ticket for me the next day. He send me a guy named Hemanth who is a staff of Air India and after reaching at the ticket counter, he sneaked away without saying anything. Then a guy named Rahul came up and he was the worst. He said he cannot do anything and if I need a ticket, pay him 3 lakh or 7 lakh. And when I asked for refund, he said he is not going to pay me anything and shouted at me to leave. I stayed there for LITERALLY MORE THAN 10 HOURS from 1 am in the morning to 11 am talking to everyone in Air India asking about this issue. No one responded in a good way and even was laughing at me. LITERALLY IRRESPONSIBLE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW TO BEHAVE. The supervisors are even worse with no responsibility. The supervisor who came on shift at 7 am or something was shouting at me back saying that ""go ask whoever didn't let you fly, I don't have anything to do with them.""They even took back my boarding pass fro Delhi to Toronto to take away the proof.Worst ever flight experience and I lost 1 lakh 10,000 rupees for a new ticket.

The flight was scheduled to depart at 11:55 AM from Toronto airport; however, our flight on 2nd Jan was delayed by 5 hours due to flight maintenance. As a result all the passengers had to spend additional time waiting at the airport during Covid time. As a result of the long delay all the passengers with connecting Domestic flights had to again check in baggage at the Delhi airport.
The flight was flying at full capacity so physical distancing is not possible. One positive was - they gave us PPE kits and in flight meals.

I am angry at the long delay at Toronto airport something that the airline could have avoided. Physical distancing is also a big concern which I believe is not under the airline's control unless there is seat capacity mandate from the Government for passenger safety.
I was tested Covid negative before starting my trip from Toronto but unfortunately after my trip I have been tested positive and as a result I thought it would be better to share my experience."

We weighed our luggage and it was about 90 kgs and as per international flight for each individual is permissible to take 30kg and we were 3 people. However, they charged us 45 thousand Indian rupees even tho we hadn't outdid the maximum weight. They perhaps need to re-do 3rd grade as it's simple sence that 3 times 3 is 90. Even tho we agreed to pay as we had a though the time for our visa to be stamped. We decided to ask another employee how much our weight was and how much we had to pay, she told us a different amount than the first employee, therefore it was a confirmed scam. But we had no other choice that to go with this cruelness. While paying, they told us they won't take card nor google pay etc. And they needed cash. We had to run around to get the money. We weren't the only ones to be cheated for luggage. Probably 3/4 people travelling were screaming at the counters for scamming, an old man near us had a bag that might not even weight 10 kgs, he was charged 4 thousand Indian rupees(he was going on an international trip too). He didn't have change and the employee asked that poor old man to go get the money in change, not caring a bit that the flight will departure soon. We started the check-in process at 4 am but it hadn't ended till 7. We weren't the only passengers here either, all of air India passengers were trying to get their luggage (with a whole lot of money taken) departured. It was a terrible experience. But it didn't end there. While the checking was going on a lot of people were late for the flights and there was no social distancing, the employees didn't even care about the pandemic right now. Air India seriously needs better staff if they want to keep their business going, not mentioning the fact their flights are horrible too. Speaking about the flight, seats were unbearable, it felt like my bones are falling off. The food was a disaster, I saw a lot of un-eaten, moderately full plates of food thrown away, even tho India believes to be a country where food doesn't go to waste. But this ased like old rusted metal served on a plate. Even expired food tastes better. I had to give it 1 star as 0 wasn't even possible.

3. the entire story is with my daughter ticket- they are arrogant and helping to add my daughter to in-laws ticket, my daughter name is spelt wrong they want me to cancel ticket and rebook they are not able to make change or lazy to do so . the patience level for the agents is 0 . initially thought i got the wrong agent tried 3 diffrent times all of them gave different responses.
4. with no choice and AI being the only flights that's PERMITTED, i have to work through this hassle.
A big no onkly if there is no choice i will never take AI.
One thing i would recommend, all airlines will try best but AI is going the other way.
not happy with the purchase and money i spent on this airline."

One of the agents later said that the tickets which were for 71k 2 hours ago had somehow raised to 1.5 lacs!!! what kind of crap is it?
Your airline represents India and this could be the most pathetic way of showing your responsibility in the ongoing pandemic.

The legroom is fantastic (easily more than Indigo), the seats were comfortable (though they need to change the seat fabric, it made me sweaty), and the pilots on both legs of my journey executed the smoothest landings I have experienced in six years of flying. I have never seen an airline serve so much food on a domestic 2-hour flight (it kept me full during a 10-hour layover). Cold meals were served owing to Covid-19 regulations, and it takes serious talent to make stone cold food taste so good (as good as Lufthansa). The planes were clean and the crew were nice and 100% compliant with Covid precautions. Entertainment options were too few."

I was afraid to travel out of Bhopal, but since in emergency I had to travel to Bareilly UP I had no choice but to fly Air India. I made all my to and fro visits through Make My Trip.
It was a wonderful experience to fly Air India. Right from entry at Bhopal Entrance where the luggage was first sanitized, then due to contactless policy of COVID norms everything thing was digital. The Air India staff was cooperative and all things including check-in, security etc went fine. At the Boarding gate the Air India staff provided us the PPE kit and mask plus faceshield and sanitizer. Since mine was middle seat I had to wear PPE kit in addition to mask and Faceshield. Boarding started well in time maintaining social distance. Since mine was 3b seat I was allowed to Board in the last batch. This practice was really good to have less contact. The flight started as soon as boarding was completed and left before time. The in-flight experience was also good with less disturbance. We reached Delhi 15 minutes before. The Protective gear were disposed by us at Airport. After taking luggage we left by Taxi to Bareilly.
In all it was a good flying experience.Worth recommending flying by Air India."

They then forbid me to board my Delhi Sydney flight and charged me a $400 penalty for that and escorted me out of IGA with rifle-weilding guards.
I then had to pay for another nights accommodation in Delhi. On return to Australia the next day, jetlagged.. I'd missed my Australian domestic flights home and had to pay again extra for that.
Note, you cancel an AI flight you lose the entire cost of the ticket. Tip - fly Singapore Airlines instead, same price point, full ticket refund if you cancel, and none of this shocking treatment and exploitation of customers.

On March 3rd I arrived at the airport around 11:45 and didn't find any counter open to check in my luggage and issue my boarding pass until 1 PM. When the counters open at 1 PM, the officials started evacuating the airport for a Bomb Scare, &sent us to an assembly point less than 1 km away from the airport. The ambulance and the firefighters arrived, & the speaker were announcing inaudible things. I was so scared that I called my family back home to let them know what's happening. I decided to leave the airport and go back to downtown to ensure my safety.
I called the customer care line around 5 times on that day to rebook my flight for the next day and change the dates. The agents kept cutting lines and putting me on hold for long, then they finally came back to me and told me that it is too late to change the flight because it is considered (No Show) and that I was supposed to call more than hour before the departure. I was actually on the phone ON Hold all the time when it was still more than 1 Hour before departure. They then referred me to Air India's airport office (who wasn't answering the phone) and said “they might have authorities to fix the situation”. I asked them if even the return flight was cancelled because I need to save time and book a new flight for the next day? They had no answer. They kept repeating the same words (it’s a no show, we have no authority to refund you Nor reschedule your flights).
I booked a new round trip flight and on the next day I went to the airport and spoke to the Air India agents, they referred me to an email. I also asked about the Evacuation, and the agent laughed and said it was just an “Exercise”.
1) I lost the money I paid for my 1st Round Trip, and my Non Refundable hotel in Mysore, and paid an extra Nights in a hotel in Bangalore, in addition to that I paid for a new round trip.

I flew finally to Mysore and had to return to Bangalore to catch my international flight in the beginning of April. India was on lock down and my country and India closed their boarders. I sent an email to Air India Customer Care, for a refund for my (second return ticket of the 2nd round trip). All I got was, we will not refund you!

Payment gets deducted and the ever glitchy website doesn't confirm the ticket. Now endless calls to customer care and you are put on hold for hours together and the team is absolutely clueless. They claim the only solution is send out email to ecommerce@airindia.in , which goes unanswered. Here there are 3 entities at work which operate completely on their own , like 3 different companies within Air-india , one is web-booking , App-booking, Call-center booking. One is not responsible for the other and Air-india as an authority doesn't exist. No you cannot demand to speak to a manager as there isn't one coming and talking to you .

Being the only airline currently plying people to the India they have monopoly over the air transportation and have lowered they're standards even further.

The misery begins online with an extremely outdated website that makes navigating to your section of interest particularly hard. They're rules about student offers and excess baggage are extremely vague and have unrealistic expectations where they expect students to book they're return ticket for months/years in advance and only then do they recieve student perks. This is extremely unrealistic since most students going abroad to study area unable to book they're return flights back home that much in advance. Air India is also one of the only airlines that has this clause, other prominent like Emirates, Singapore Airlines and British Airways have no such unrealistic demands and let you avail of student offers on a single journey.

The next stage of your miserable experience greeets you at the airport in the form of impolite, misinformed ground staff that you will encounter while trying to check in and drop off your luggage. They're lack of knowledge on they're companies guidelines and policies is appalling!

The only pleasant staff I encountered were the pursers who welcome you aboard, they're polite demeanor almost made up for the incompotent staff I earlier encountered, but the rest of the cabin crew was, again, not particularly pleasant.

The WORST part of this trip was the fact that they're inflight entertainment systems were ""Under Maintainence"" and I had to endure a ten hour journey with nothing but a blank screen in front of me. To make things worse all the plug points on the plane were ""Down"" and it was impossible to charge a phone or laptop and amuse yourself with your personal electronic devices unless you, keeping Air India's tardiness in mind, had charged all your devices and back up batteries to the max.

And if you thought this flight couldn't possibly get any worse, lo-and-behold, the reading lights didn't work either! So if you thought you could spend a few leisurely hours curled up with a good book, Air India has stumped you, yet again. About 70% of this flight took place between dusk and dawn. Furthermore, the cabin lights were dimmed for most of the flight so if you couldn't fall asleep you were left spending about seven miserable hours in dark - miserable, cramped and bored!"

My flights got canceled due to Covid, and I had no problem at all to get my refunds from other airlines from Thailand and Myanmar, but it's been a nightmare with AIRINDIA.

You try to contact AirIndia @contactus but for some weird reason they can't help you with bookings or refund (????) or anything at all. Then you try to contact @ecommerce as suggested by Airindia itself and there is where the show begins. They will start helpful, apologetic, they ask you your PNR number, date of travels, etc, and then, they DISAPPEAR. Then you try to contact them again, trying to follow up, and they come up with another story, like you need to call the company in India because they need vocal confirmation, or that they will help you with your re-booking no problem at all, or if you can please share your PNR number (you have no idea how many times I had to share that information).

It's not only the worst experience I've ever had when it comes to an airline, it's mockery I cannot stand, and the fact that I probably lost more than a $1K to a horrible company.

However, Air India is saying they will refund the money only to them who booked from 23rd March. So people who booked flight for 22nd March will not get the refund. I was told to call e-commerce department but no one answers the phone there even if I waited for 30 to 45 Minutes to be connected.

Secondly, I booked the flights from Chicago to India because I had to come back to India as I lost my job due to this pandemic Covid-19. I’m not sure I flew under “Vande Bharat Mission” or “Save Air India Mission”. The price was higher than the regular. I thought Air India took initiative to bring Indians back to India but I was wrong because Air India is getting profitable business in this pandemic specially from those people who have lost their jobs.

Now whatever I’m going to write it has no link with what I wrote above. Being in the hospitality industry, This is my observation in the flight from Chicago to Delhi. I was impressed because Air India staff was conscious about the precautions from
Covid-19 at the time boarding. It was mandatory for every one to wear face shield and mask and sealed food on each seat inside the flight but I saw there was no instructions for social distances as it was at the airport. Most of the airlines have blocked middle seats in the aircraft to keep distance between two passengers but Air India is not following this because more passengers more profit. So people were seating next to each other with no choice.
In 13+ hours flight they provided us one sandwich, one juice and some snacks such as chips packet, one, nuts, one croissant, butter, cheese, yogurt etc. I don’t think that I have to mention here the quantity or size of the snacks as every one knows. Basically, There was not even one proper meal.

As soon as I took my seat, I tried to keep my food on fold-out table. Unfortunately the fold out table had a missing screw so the things were slipping and falling over me. Somehow I managed. Then, I decided to watch something in-flight entertainment system but there was something wrong. So by pointing on system I asked the staff, “Excuse me! Is it not working?” He replied, “ Yes ! It’s not working.” And he left without apologizing for the inconvenience. Actually, In-flight entertainment system was not working anyone, so I was not the only lucky one.
Toilets were horrible. I haven’t seen toilets in this condition in any flight, even in the cheapest flights. There were stickers behind the toilet seat I don’t know whether those sticker were to hide some crack or not but surely it was not appropriate. The surrounding of soap dispenser and tap was covered by dirty moss. No supply of tissues. Once finished is finished. I went to get some extra bottled water and I found one of the staff members was sleeping or napping sitting up while on duty.

I understand some annoying guests make the staff irritated but when you work in hospitality industry as a staff member you have to polite all the time, you can’t be aggressive. However, I saw staff talking to other guests by pointing finger on them and with Forehead Furrows.

Also when I entered in the aircraft was greeted just for formality. Usually “Namaskar” greeting accompanied by hand gesture in which palms are together but her fingers of both hands were barely touching each other. While leaving the aircraft, none of the staff members was thanking the guests. There were two staff members were standing at the door quietly.

I’m not going to write any suggestion. Air India must know what to do."

So the next month of April I register online to go home from Dubai as a part of Vande Bharat mission started by Indian Government.On may 9th consulate of general India Dubai called me and told me as I applied online to go home so they have arranged a flight for me to Amritsar on 13 may. As per them just wait for 2 days I will get a call from air India and they will discuss the flight details with me. But air India never called me. Again I called the embassy number they never answered my call.
Same thing happened in June also Consulate of general India Dubai called me on 7 June same thing they told me that my name is in the list of Vande Bharat mission to evacuate. There is one flight on 11 June to Jammu airport. Wait I will get a call from air India. I told them last month same thing happens but I didn't received any call from air India. My father is very sick now I need to be with him. They said don't worry this time air India surely will call me. But same thing repeated again. I wait for air India call, no one called me this time. My father's health getting critical now. I called the embassy no answer. I try to call air India office in Dubai. Seems both embassy and air India staff are sleeping on duty. I tweet air India on twitter about my situation no one responded. I was so helpless. Finally my father passed away on 4th July. Still I am struggling to get a ticket. I went to embassy also. Finally in embassy they answered my call and I explained what air India did to me. They said they also don't know what air India is doing. My name is there in list to go India. Still they didn't called me. Then embassy raised an emergency request to send me to India as I gave them my father's death certificate. After that air India call me and book a flight for me.
I want to ask air India. When my name is in the list to evacuate and I got call twice from Consulate general of India dubai. Both time they told me I will get a call from air India . Why Air India never called me. Why you guys only consider a emergency is actually a emergency after someone's death. If I got the called from air India in may only may be I could treat my father in a better place. May be he is still alive and healthy. Never trust air India."

We were charged change fees on first re-schedule of the 2 tickets for their return flight as my wife fell sick around date of return (first week of March). Most of the airlines were waiving off the change fees though. And the re-scheduled flight (in April) did not take off due to lock down in India.

Eventually after announcement of special repatriation Air India flights when we saw some hope to get them back here in SFO & re-unite the eniter family BUT we struggled painfully trying to get them re-booked. Waited for hours and hours on countless occasions for several days on wait/music trying to get someone from customer service over phone and all the time no meaningful help was offered. Nobody seemed to show interest in re-scheduling the return ticket (which could not be used due to air travel shut off due to lock down) and insisted to pay fresh tickets price (which were unreasonably high in business class).

Once again after our continuous & countless calls to Air India customer service that usually got attention after several hours of waits/holds on music each time and numerous personal visits & begging in front of their your local ticketing office staff (in sector 34, Chandigarh India) and paying hefty charges/fair-differences/taxes & what-not, we finally still felt slightly okay that after all we got scheduled to fly back on June 12th flight (AI 173).

But eventually it was to our immense disappointment when on the date of flight at Delhi airport we were told that we have been secretly downgraded to economy class WITHOUT any of their staff members giving us a slightest possible hints about this drastic change to our re-scheduled ticket. We had previously been struggling ONLY to get our family booked in same/business class as our originally scheduled ticket which got void due to lock down. Had any of the airline's staff member at the ticketing office mentioned about this such an important piece of information pertaining to the class-change, we would have NEVER gotten settled for this return flight.

It was shockingly harassing experience for my spouse with my little 3 year old son when she was told at the boarding counter that suddenly the ticket issued was NOT business class anymore. And to add to this mental torture there were no upgrades available on the spot when we decided to make our mind to pay even more money on top off already charged huge sum of money. We all were in a state of shockingly huge disappointment and went through huge mental & physical harassment for the entire return journey that my spouse & my son had to forcefully experience, given no choice (after travelling almost full day to airport by road and learning that they don’t have any choice but to travel in downgraded economy class that no one communicated to us at any point during or after the entire re-issuing ticketing process).

To add to this chain of disturbing events during this worst travel experience my son’s stroller was declared lost/missing upon arrival in SFO such that my wife had to hold him as well carry the luggage all the way to the ground transportation point that is actually a very long walk through long queues & waiting times in immigration/custom queues. And finally upon reaching home we surprisingly got call (as if it was some sort of courtesy) from air india ground staff that ""your baby stroller had been found and you would need to come back all the way back to SFO airport from where ever you are currently located and pick it up"". It was ridiculously hopeless response on delayed/missing luggage filed issues that are usually entertained & serviced via shipping in addition to appropriate compensation for the sufferings caused.

Anyway we wanted to share the entire series of issues we have faced during this frustratingly awful travel experience through air india when we had been desperately begging for help to schedule our return ticket to be able to re-unite with entire family, for many many weeks using all possible communication channels and without getting useful response. And when we finally got one by paying countless personal visits to one of your local ticketing office it led to even much bigger & disastrous mess, mental/physical torture with involuntary downgraded travel class, missing stroller & so on.

We will definitely avoid travelling air india in future."

They offered a food service in business class however, when we took a look at what appeared to be some dried up and congealed concoction we opted to skip the meal. I usually fly over 100,000 miles a year and have never experienced a flight in an aircraft that has been as poorly maintained as the one I was on. On the other hand, flight was on time and flight attendants seemed nice enough. I wonder whether the mechanical maintenance on Air India is as poor as the way they maintain the interior of their aircraft. Just in case, I will not be flying AI again."

Not to mention I spent half hour waiting for the agent to connect to the agent. So, overall I have spent 3 hours just trying to get the change made, and still no success.

Where do I start? I had a confirmed flight ticket booked for 6 June 2020 from Kolkata to London and the airline cancelled the flight. However, they never notified me of the cancellation (and options available to me). The phone lines mentioned in their website are not reachable at all (I have tried multiple times on all 3 numbers they have provided). When contacted 3 days before the flight (via email), they gave me only one option to reschedule the flight but that would cost me the fare difference (guaranteed as airlines would increase prices after COVID-19 travel restrictions are relaxed). There was no option for the customer to get their money back (even partially). The email responses were a hot and miss - sometimes ignored and sometimes answered. When asked for a cancellation (based on normal cancellation rules), they made charged me a penalty fees. Why should I pay a penalty if I am willing to travel and the airline has cancelled. Finally, they agreed to cancel but not willing/able to tell me the amount that would be refunded. So both the options provided to the customers are unknown in terms of cost - a business like this should be brought to court in any civilised part of the world.

On our flight home we discovered that someone at air india had canceled our booking and moved us to a flight the following day!! We ended up having to pay £260 to get back on the original flight we had already booked and paid for! The man on the service desk was very unhelpful and did not seem to care.
Then when we landed in the uk they had lost all our bags, the help desk in london for air india was again pretty useless so after trying to get some help for several hours we left the airport with no idea what to do.
I tried calling several different numbers, emailing and each time redirected again and again. eventually i spoke to the baggage handling company who found my bags and they were returned the end of the following week
I tried to contact air india about a refund for the £260 and was passed from pillar to post, saying they could give me a refund then they couldnt, admitting their guilt but being unwilling to help always saying oh call back tomorrow.

The staff is unbelievably rude, indifferent and incompetent. And goes for both ground and inflight staff. The planes makes you feel unsafe, like they might fall apart any minute, the inflight entertainment on international flights are a joke, the passenger comfort is non existent, and they are not even cheap. You can easily find other flights/airlines who will provide better everything at much better prices.
The window shade on the so called “Dreamliner”, is centrally controlled, which means on an international flight, in the daytime, you are forced to spend 8 hours in artificial darkness. Way to promote jetlag.
I will probably not travel on Air India again. There are many other airlines who takes passenger comfort, security and satisfaction way more seriously."

On Ground

Great job by DIAL (Delhi Airport) in following government guidelines. Easy step by step with most people following instructions. From arrival to check in, Air India ground staff were helpful, compassionate and understanding. All standard operating protocols were followed. So far so good.

In Air

Now the nightmare starts with the she devils - the Air India hostess’s - crude , unhelpful, unrefined etc. Many more adjectives I can go on with.

This particular flight had lot of elderly and single mothers with young kids. The young mothers who sat on bulkhead seats were not given bassinets for the babies in spite of request. Sad part is that the air hostess’s promised to provide one but never gave one. Imagine holding your baby for 16 hours. Just cruel!

No In Flight Entertainment - what is the connection with earphones and covid. I had my iPad was able to enjoy a bit but it defies any logic not to provide something. I have not seen any advisory on it.

Restrooms - my fellow Indians, you must practice keeping it clean. Do your part and the staff can do theirs. Don’t litter, be mindful of what you expect. The bathrooms were not sanitized every couple of hours as was told before the flight by the she devils of Air India.

The food for the repatriation flight was put on our seats - ordinary to say the least but so much junk food. I would advice customers to pack their own food if permitted, check with the airlines. So the Air India Chef is either a duffer or has no idea how to create a menu of cold food that can last 24 hours as there was no HOT food and beverage service. Yes, covid situation is tough but there are far more creative ways of doing then just giving popcorn, KitKat, mixture mix and sandwiches that were not wrapped properly and completely dry to eat - practically inedible.

Once we landed in New York, all the passengers got up with no regards to social distancing. Please explain this unique Indian phenomenon of taking out luggage and standing before the aircraft door is open. I typically sit for all them to leave and come out last.

Finally what has been said about Air India aircraft conditions are true. Most food trays are broken, seats are uncomfortable and decor unimaginative. No wonder you are going out of business.

One last point, why is that we have the Indian mentality of cleaning our area and piling garbage in the galley. You were asked to put all garbage under your seat yet most people did not. As long as my space is clean I couldn’t care less about

I do thank the Indian government for doing a heroic job of getting so many stranded Indians. Very commendable. I just wished Air India would have stepped up with this opportunity of a life time to improve their status."

My friend and I made our first trip together to India. We are both Canadian students travelling abroad alone for a youth conference and were completely traumatized by our experience with Air India.

Upon arrival, our luggage was missing and did not make it to Delhi when we landed. They had provided no explanations as to why our luggages weren't delivered on time. So this is where a series of lies, deceptions, and empty promises begin! (apparently very common here).

We were told that our luggages will be ""arriving with the next flight coming in"" from Toronto>Paris>Delhi. They had re-assured us multiple times that there is nothing we can do here at the airport and that our luggage will surely be in Delhi by ""tomorrow morning"" (a lie). They also re-assured us that they would deliver our luggage to our hotels in the morning (another lie). We provided our addressed and confirmed this information multiple times. We also had to complete forms describing our travel route and provided descriptions of our luggages. So with this info from the Air India office in Indira Gandhi Airport, we left and took down the customer service number they had provided.

We were in a new country with none of our belongings and left stranded for 6 days. We called the customer service line multiple times every day with no luck. We would get a person on the line if we called earlier in the day (6-7 am) but they were still unhelpful and would not provide any updates on our luggages. They hung up on us almost every call. Without exaggeration, we made over 130 calls day/night for 6 days straight.

We finally got more info about our luggages once we informed the staff that we were going to report them to the Canadian embassy. Air India staff had said they ""did not have enough man power to make the delivery to our hotels"" and that our luggages ""were with the delivery person"". We demanded our luggages to be delivered. Without luck or further updates, we were able to get a hold of another customer service rep so we asked him for the address of this ""delivery person"" bc we will have to go pick up the luggages on our own. We received a phone number of a random man and contacted him in order to meet up for our luggages. Once we met the man, we realized one of our luggages were missing. He was the only person to sympathize with us and tried to help us track down the other luggage by making some calls. He had told us that this is common when travelling Air India. (we literally met up with a random man and his mini van to pick up our luggages!!!! extremely disconcerting)

After another back and forth with Air India, we returned to the airport and finally picked up the other luggage (after waiting ~3 HOURS to the airport). It was a complete disaster and extremely stressful.

Our return experience was even worse.

As students on work trips, we did not have a lot of cash on us. They overcharged us for baggage fees (almost $800USD, which had us mortified). They would not provide any explanation as to how they make overage charges. We were asking multiple Air India staff on duty about how they got to this number (was it based on kg or was it a fixed price for all bags that were overweight?). One woman said it was by kg, I think she quoted ~500 rupees per kg or something like that. In which case it makes NO sense why we were being charged $750USD per person. I had about 8 kg over, while my fried had 11 kg of extra weight. Another staff had said they charge by bag, so any bag that is overweight will be x amount of money...

We got our tickets via an app called Hopper. According to Hopper, we were allowed one luggage each (as well as a carry on and personal bag) and any ADDITIONAL CHECKED BAGS would be $100 CAD. So we showed our ticket and this message/policy to the Air India staff and they just would not accept it. They were persistent that we pay the ~750USD per person. We explained that we were students and asked them HOW they got to $750USD per person because no-one would provide us with a break down of this fee.

We arrived 3 hours early and they wasted ~2hours trying to generate this $750 receipt for us to pay. They were working extremely slowly and moved us from one counter to the next. There was no manager on site to help us. After this back and forth, a man finally gave me a piece of paper (a random piece of paper with his ""calculations"" written with a pencil about how much we should pay for the extra weight in each of our luggages). We COULD NOT make the payment unless we had this piece of paper. He handed this to us about 15 mins before our boarding closed.

Once we went over to the other counter to pay this with our USD, the same guy came over and said ""it's too late, you are not going on that flight"". It was a nightmare. No explanations, no sympathy, and complete abuse of power.

They didn’t let us on the flight, and marked our statuses as “no show”. After ongoing arguments for over 10 hours at the airport with every staff of various positions, they told us to wait for 24 hours at the airport to receive a decision informing that this issue would be resolved. Luckily we had connections to remain in the airport lounge, after waiting for a whole night at the airport, we were informed that we had to purchase new tickets. Word for word “pay the price, or choose to suffer here”. Even the police weren’t able to help us, and they lied to every authority figure, even though we continuously mentioned to check the CCTV for proof (which they ignored). The staff laughed at us, verbally shamed us, and lied to us and others about our situation. I'm not sure what they got from this experience (other than traumatizing two young women/students).

This was a horrendous experience that I'll never forget from Air India. *just imagine being stranded and robbed of your flight home for no good reason...
The sad thing was they took advantage of every situation and abuse of power was evident with every counter we went to and every staff person we interacted with.

ZERO customer service, zero satisfaction, and absolutely no humane decency

Take precautions! You're in a new country, universal airline policies won't always apply. They will simply reject whatever paper or policies you are referring and will not budge. Simply horrendous staff."

Even the police weren’t able to help us, and they lied to every authority figure, even though we continuously mentioned to check the CCTV for proof (which they ignored). The staff laughed at us, verbally shamed us, and lied to us and others about our situation. I'm not sure what they got from this experience and will never understand.
This was a traumatic experience that I'll never forget from Air India.
The sad thing was they took advantage of every situation, with a lack of customer service, satisfaction, and humane decency and morals.
This was a huge downfall for our trip and we were devastated."

To have no movies to watch on a 14 hour flight makes the hours go by slowly. The food is OK but usually hot and spicy India food which doesn't fit well with me. I ask for bland food but have never received anything except what everyone else is eating. The airline feeds you three time and a snack in a 14 hour period. Which is too much and much food is wasted. I will continue to use Air India because it gets me there nonstop instead of going through Germany.

We had to wait until three hours before the flight to check in with Air India. The airport was essentially empty. One member of our party had to go through the 3rd degree about his wheel chair battery, but to be fair all the other airlines we flew also gave him the third degree about the battery. He did wind up carrying it aboard the plane, which is what he had done on most of our flights. Cost him extra $150 for luggage (20 Kilo over). There was a very understanding Indian lady in charge of the counter. Found out later she is the 3rd generation working for Air India. She was most helpful and pleasant. She came to us in the Air India lounge to make sure all was well. She was at the gate and even on the plane to make sure everything was ok before we departed. Only 24 people on our flight. She said normally this plane is booked up 6 months in advance, but due to the COVID-19 no one is flying. We did pickup 110 people when we stopped in Gaya en-route to New Delhi. So we are giving a shout out to this very kind lady for all of her care and support. Thank you."

I was told they would send it to my hotel. They refused to send my bag on the very first flight to Delhi so it only arrived 3 days later with their own airline. I got called 4 days later that my bag was in Jaipur but that they were not going to drive it to my hotel! I had to take a taxi all the way to the airport costing me money and time. Once at the airport no one had seen my bag and I waited for an hour while 1 woman made phone calls and the other 4 women stood around doing nothing. There was a pile of lost luggage which they didn’t even look through, only the top was looked at. I asked to come inside to look at all the luggage as it might be under the rest of the luggage. This was not allowed. When I asked one of them to look they moved one bag away from the 30 bags there and walked away. Turned out my bag wasn’t there after waiting for 1 hour. I ended up receiving my bag 1 week later at my hotel after more than a week alone in India without my luggage at the age of 18…"

Firstly, the flight attendants were extremely rude. I understand that their job is hard, but they had an extremely unpleasant attitude. Halfway through the flight, my entertainment screen stopped working, and when I asked the flight attendants for some help, they said “Sorry, we can’t help you fix that and we’re landing in only 4.5 hours”. I was appalled, as I had paid for the seat and they hadn’t even made an attempt to help me. While the food was being handed out, I was sleeping so the flight attendant gave me the non-vegetarian option. I am vegetarian, so I asked the flight attendant for an alternative meal, and she simply said “We can’t get any other meal”. The condition of the plane was horrible, as it seemed a million years old. It was super dirty, and the seats were not comfortable AT ALL. And also, I couldn’t book business class because there was an urgent event that I needed to go to, but if you need legroom, don’t book on economy. Overall, I had an awful experience on Air India and I will definitely never fly on this failed airline again."

But just before i boarded the said customs had refused with my baggage as i was not physical there to pick up my baggage. I could not comprehend but they said to just fill a form online and would get my baggage which i have done with no response from anyone.

2..They had more than 12hrs to tell me about my baggage but the waited until last minute when i could not do anything.

I have tried to contact Air India for my baggage with no help i tried all emails online but only one office contacted me back the Goa office this was their response:

In any case, how does the country lock-down prevent you from collecting you bag at the airport when you arrived?

We were due to fly back to the UK on 19 march but were alerted via a news medium (not air india I hasten to add) that all Air India flights on that day were now cancelled. So on the 18th march we drove straight to Delhi airport to see if we could fly home. Air India had 3 remaining flights on 18th going to the UK so we asked if we could be squeezed on one of the flights as our flight had been cancelled BY AIR INDIA. Air India's reply was there were no more economy seats available but plenty of 1st class to which we would be required to pay £3500 EACH extra to board. we said we we were happy to pay a little extra but £3500...really. My understanding was that if an airline cancels the flight they have a duty of care to get you on another flight especially in a crisis.
The queue for Air Indias desk on the 18th March was full of Brits trying desperately to get home, we we were all absolutely appalled and shocked by the lack of Air Indias compassion during this difficult time and less than helpful attitude...they couldnt care less. . Air India's final response was you can all have a refund but you will need to apply for this...great, so how are we meant to get home.. not their problem. Next!!

If you are able to fill up questions in hundreds, you can become a medical professional ! The doctor whom I approached also wondered. As per the instruction therein, the application is to be submitted in advance at any AI office. Accordingly I went to the AI office at Sanrtacruz. At the gate i reached first, the security have directed me to another gate kilometres away. There, the security asked me to approach a counter near by. The 'AI Maharaja' in counter without heeding me simply asked me to meet the security. (I am sure that he was watching all my movements from my entry itself). Feeling pity on me the security approached me and told me to go to the booking counter itself instead of running between gates. He himself called an auto and directed the driver to drop me at the booking counter. The way to counter was blocked by cleaning parties. I have approached an AI staff came out and he simply pointed to the boarding pass area. Then another person came out. After hearing me he told me that the wheel chair can be booked online. On showing the application got from AI web site he also hesitated and left. Finally a cleaning person let me in. There, I showed the form and flight ticket to the lady. With out hearing me, she gave me a print out. It was nothing but a brief of my journey ticket. Again I explained the matter. She told that I have to aske the boarding pass staff to provide wheel chair and turned to whatsapp. Again I told her that the security will not allow to boarding section with out a flight ticket of the day and my ticket is of another day. With out raising head from whatsapp, she replied me to come on the day of my flight and they will give wheel chair. Finally the day of flight came. On the entrance, the security asked us to walk to the counter and then ask for wheel chair. Some how, we reached the counter. There the lady simply pointed to another corner.

On the other side, the whole world is so concerned to handle this difficult time and helping people. I lost my travel only because of miss-communication by their call center agent when it was so important for me to bring my mother to Canada as she is alone after my father died. Now my return ticket to Toronto is also not showing anywhere. Please think as many time before considering travel through Air India..."

This caused me to be unable to board my flight For 11 hours. I had to book another flight and And the airline refuse to provide any compensation and I had to pay for the flight on my own. We found out at the airport that the stuff and clean the refund in New Delhi even though I was not in India and boarded my flight to India after that date

We had a trip booked for March 20, 2020 - April 10, 2020. Because of the Coronavirus outbreak out Visas got cancelled and all airports shut down which left us no choice but to call and cancel our trip.

We called numerous times and we waited hours on the phone which is understandable. However, we called a few times and each time they would hang up on us so we had to call back over and over.

On top of that, even though we could not go on our trip. They told us that we had to pay $1100 for the tickets to cancel which was almost the price of one ticket. We let them know that we thought thy it was unfair as it was not our fault and they would just hang up which prompted us to have to call again and again.

I would not recommend this airline to anyone as they don’t care about anyone. Even when you call the people on the phone are just outright rude to you.

Always take any other flight rather than Air India."

They just mentioned that they were doing going to refund but all they do is to charge people more during the crisis. This is a terrible airline which I will avoid at all costs.

Their website is awful and confusing. It has very few options available.

Their customer service is abysmal. I had to call at least 10 different numbers to find out the airlines correct customer support number, the phone number mentioned on their website doesn't work. After finally getting their number, I had to wait for 2 hours to get a proper answer. To find out the answer to my question, the representative was reading some kind of updates and mumbling, they could have at least used the hold option. My issue was not resolved completely. I requested to talk to a manager, to which I was lied to about first, the representative said they do not have a manager at all. I was shocked and asked how could there not be a manager for a business, the representative then said that the manager was not on the FLOOR. It was the most awful customer service ever."

It's a free for all so you get to your seat slowly and realize that this is one really old plane. The seat is stained and the best one can do is wipe down everything and hope for the best. It was a 2 hour flight and food was passed out - rice and some sauce but passable enough to eat when you're hungry. The landing was pretty rough getting into Delhi but we were just glad that we made it. Air India gets you where you need to go but no luxury here.

Then you to to security where they make you stand in a sue for another 2 hours (min) because for some reason they think its necessary to check you through immigration for an internal flight, then they have delay after delay after delay waiting at the gate.

The aircraft are like flying London taxis and are dirty, overcrowded and not clean. Locals carry on too much baggage so you can never find an overhead locker anywhere your seat. When you land therefore you have to wait until the plane is empty before you can retrieved your carry-on bag as its half way foes the plane. Children are uncontrolled, alcohol flows freely and Indians like to drink! Once on the taxiway, a further delay for 40 minutes whilst they threw a couple of passengers off the aircraft, and retrieved their luggage from the hold, then eventually we took off.

There was a gap at the back of the seat. I put a pillow in the gap, however it was extremely uncomfortable. I also noticed missing trim on several seats. The food tray that I used did not hang properly and I also noticed other trays that were dangling precariously. The inflight entertainment system is also pretty old and out-of-date. The system went out a few times which required that you had to begin watching your movie from the beginning. The controls in my seat were not properly working. The flight attendant stated that they could not fix it and suggested I used the control in the seat next to me. Based on this experience if I have other options I will avoid."

Think about a putting a small kid away from mother and father in a 20hr international flight. The seats are broken, you cannot sit straight in the seats as the leg space is taken away by some repairs at the leg space or by design. Entertainment systems won't work. Inexperienced staff at checkin who does not have a clue what happens to the luggage if if I have a connecting fleight from EWR.

We hoped that as part of Star alliance we’d be put on a BA flight or Virgin but we can now see why there was plenty of seats on Air India business class. The only good thing was the very ample leg room and amenities bag with Herbal products.

This Flight hadn’t been cleaned properly When we got on our tables were covered in dirty marks and we were told by a very grumpy member of staff that we could clean our tables ourselves if we wanted to (in business class). Not a way to treat a customer who has save up for a bit more comfort.
No drink served for 2 hours, food served 4 hours into flight. Food was edible but not the same as other Business Class standard. Very disappointed as staff were totally disinterested in providing good service to all travellers. One staff member allowed us all to clear our own tables, there were trays all over the cabin left uncleared. One passenger asked for a Bloody Mary and got just tomato juice and had to ask again for the vodka. We asked for champagne it was still warm 2 hrs into the flight and only received one glass unless we asked for top up.

Staff spent most of the time in the galley and if you appeared you were told to go back to your seats. Another passenger did not take his tray up but after 45 mins actually held it out for her to take away. Two of the screen seats had to be reset (that took 30 mins to get someone to do it).

Toilets okay but a bit smelly but at least clean. Bits of tissue left here and there.

Food before landing was very basic too. I remember a very dry sponge and a samosa, but got a cup of tea at least. Many passengers asked when beverages would be served. In 8 hr flight tea came round once.

There was no service with a smile or apology. Have travelled business to and from Mumbai before and was a much better, more professional, good service by mature staff. On that flight Food also much better served with mithai and chocolate from Mumbai. I was told when I asked “it’s a different route ma’am”. The cabin was not completely full on this occasion and it could have been a nicer experience with a few changes.

Sadly from our experience and 5 other passengers who spoke to us we would not recommend this from flight Delhi to London."

They can not guarantee customers safety and will not credit a rebooking within a year. This is outrageous. We have elderly parents we are traveling with and can not risk the exposure. Both countries (USA and India) are saying to postpone unnecessary travel. Other US airlines are refunding in full due to the medical circumstance. I guess honor gets in the way of profit. Please do NOT buy Air India, spend the extra money on a US airlines to be treated like a human. We also were hung up on 4 times. Worst customer service ever. I am also a teacher and can not risk returning from travel to enter into a classroom full of children. I wish they could have a heart and understand that, in addition to 400$ Is not an amount a teacher can throw away. Trying to be responsible and avoid the risk. Air India does not seem to care about the risk."

As I understand 1 plus hour delays are normal. Starting at delhi , we were seated on time i.e before 4am. Flight never took off for 2+ hours. In the end, we were suppose to reach at 6am. We reached at 9 am. Very old aircraft. Cabin crew mentained, most of the entertainment systems on seats did not work. Their complaints do not go any where."

This is unavoidable and I would rather fly on a safe plane, so this is not my issue. After announcing an initial delay of 4 hours, the board kept putting the departure back by 20 minutes at a time for about 90 minutes, after this the board didn't change until the plane took off at midnight.

The guy on the departure desk was useless and gave no information about the delay, nor did they offer any food vouchers to people traveling with families & young children. Communication was zero for any progress and it was difficult to know if the plane would take off at all. The customer service from this airline is dreadful."

Why doesn’t AI put people differently abled in the front of the plane so this won’t reoccur! It was a very anxiety producing moment!!! And the plane seat pockets had not been cleaned as well- I also had to use the wash room which is in the rear of the plane and couldn’t get to it due to the passenger!!!

Thank you for the great experience and keep it up."

We were shocked after seeing a lady being taken first onto the plane in a wheelchair, and then when we boarded, seeing her seated, but her suitcase was still in the aisle. We put her suitcase in the overhead compartment for her. She was very thankful.

When we landed in Delhi, the plane was a distance from the terminal, and steps were brought out for everyone to deplane. We were very surprised to see her slowly descending the steps, without assistance from anyone, and she slowly walked to the shuttle bus to the terminal, again without any assistance. We don't know the story behind us, but she seemed terribly upset when she reached her family."

Morning flight 9:30am did not provide any breakfast and served snack of peanuts 2hours into flight. Main meal was served later and before arriving cold cheese roll. Arriving at ATQ took 2 hours reclaiming baggage when there was only 1 flight arriving, wonder how they will deal with multiple flights arriving!!! On our return from Amritsar to Stanstead 3:00am flight, cold cheese roll was served and no other refreshments or snacks until we had 1 hour to land breakfast was served. As family we will never be flying with Air India and reccomend to take your own food, snacks."

I had a comfortable and enjoyable return flight and will recommend Air India business flights to my friends."

Had another local itinerary from Dharmasala to Delhi and supposed to be departed at 11:20AM it was deayed again and got SMS notification that flight will be departing at 11:50AM. Came to airport and the airport representative said that flight might cancel due to technical issue, same excuses which they gave with our flight from Male!!

Also, never pay for first row or extra leg room seats, they don't provide the same at the time of check in although you have proof of payment and are made to sit on normal seats. And refund for the priority seat is impossible as after hunting for 1.5 months for refund I have stopped now as tired of following up."
