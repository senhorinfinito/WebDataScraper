We had to find the Air India office at the airport and the staff did not want to make any announcement that the flight was cancelled. Since it was a weekend the other flights were full and we had no option. The staff did not wanted to help and they did not arrange anything first. Then some Indians raised their voices and the staff then made announcement and arranged some refreshments and finally we got seat in the night flight.

The flight inside was a mess. it had the smell of spices inside the cabin and the seats were so dirty. (I found some oil patches on seat head cover and hair on seat and also on the window) they even did not use an airfreshner. It was a bad experience for me.

Air India is famous for flight cancellation. Same thing happend for a few of my friends too."

We requested a window seat and did receive one but got sat somewhere there wasn't actually a window... Made me chuckle a bit and at least a good place to sleep on. The staff let people start changing seats and letting others sit in other peoples seats before the flight had even finished boarding so it felt like a bit of a free for all. I was asked to give up my seat and separate from my partner so two people who also knew each other could sit next to each other... No sorry. I was then made to feel like I was the bad person. The food was so spicy, not what I really wanted on a flight! The staff were very abrupt and rude and I really wouldn't fly with Air India in a hurry again."

Economy",Decent Flight With Used Dreamliner,"Was pleasantly surprised when I found out the flight was going to be by Dreamliner.
But the maintenance of the cabin lacked attention to details.
The USB charger socket was broken. The touch screen was ""numb"". The monitor lose. The inflight entertainment system had to be restarted twice to work. The ""foreign"" movie selection (non Indian movies) was very limited.
On the positive side: The flight attendant were very accommodating! :-)
I found the food really good!
Not to mention then Departure and Arrival was on time!
Overall, not too bad."

The leg space is excellent even in the economy class. The food and snacks are typical indian and as an Indian I liked them. I, however, noticed that they were also providing continental food on request.

The entertainment selection was generous as far as hindi movies and songs was concerned. The airlines needs to add some more variety to english selection.

Overall a very comfortable flight."
