As usual flight departed late . Aircraft an A320neo .seats are horrible .can compete with indigo .no pillow, blankets ,no IFE,stale food and overall feel like travelling a third rate low cost carrier .

Pilots made no announcements .no appology for delay as well

How can a sector which is 6 hrs duration operated with a narrow body with zero comfort .stay away from this airline on AI382 Del sin"

Economy","Convenient and timely route (DEL-ARN), everything else not so good","This route is using the Dreamliner 787 fleet, which is a very nice aircraft - healthier air, lower cabin altitude, dimmable-windows and healthier cabin pressure.

The time time table (both ways) for this route is also very convenient. and, of course, the very generous checked baggage allowance gives many brownie points.

The boarding process is efficient and both flights were on time.

Now, to the bad points:

- Inflight meals (Economy) is horrible. Probably the worse inflight meals i've eaten (and I fly a lot!)
- Alcohol is served but very limited. We got a pre dinner bar service, but no drinks (at all) were served later with actual dinner.
- The cabin crew service and friendliness? Non-existent!"

However we kept on waiting till 2330 when we were informed that there will be a delay in departure. By that time the ground power unit stopped supporting the air conditioning. Finally the flight left at around 0100 and till that time the passengers were not served anything. The reason for the delay ? A connecting flight from Hyderabad was delayed from which more than 30 passengers had to join this flight. My only complaint is that the ground staff could have found out about their Hyderabad flight's ETA before they started boarding and accordingly delayed the boarding instead of making the passengers wait inside the uncomfortable and suffocating environment of the stationary aircraft.

It will take a 10 pages to explain how they are able to humiliate the people. Definitely not recommended!!!
Stay away from them. Better use a camel."

Economy",Very poorly maintained Airline,"The aircraft is poorly maintained with something or the other not working. The movie screens not working on some seats. The air hostess started serving food and when she came to my seat told me ""Non veg is over, now you will get only veg"" What a way to put it across. Need more training on how to interact with passengers. It would be nice if the staff could smile. The only reason why we took this flight, is because we could book from Pune to Chicago (via Delhi) and its a direct fight from Delhi. This aircraft is only good for getting transported from point A to point B. Not worth the money. Period."

You have enough leg space. 25 kgs is allowed as the check-in baggage which is good for people who are travelling for a month or so. Cabin Crew are extremely well groomed and helpful. Food served in the flight is also good"

The brand new Aircraft named 'Punjab' had comfortable seats and excellent entertainment programs. The personal TV screens and audio was very good. The in-flight crew was always at the service of passengers with warmth in food and heart, under the able guidance of IFS Prashant Jog, who was supervising his last flight after 35 years of service in Air India. The Commander and passengers wished Prashant, happy & healthy retired life. I like Air India ."

On board the flight we were shown our seats and we were not happy to be seated at the on the same row as the wings of the plane. We approached the air hostess and she politely said to us that she will see what she can do to assist us when the plane was ready for take off. within 10 minutes she moved to where there was available seats to our satisfaction. Really customer service at its best. The care care taken of all passengers on board the flight was brilliant. WEll done Air India."

Best to be at the gate 30 minutes before the departure ( 6.20AM). The flight was comfortable, it landed in Jollygrant well ahead of the scheduled time and the bags were on belt in less than 10 minutes. Good experience !"

My journey plan is from Blore to Kolkata by AI776 and Kolkata to Guwahati by AI729 in two separate tickets. My request for cargo luggage internal transfer at kolkatta was not entertained by the Blore staff. Air india is not doing such a small service to the customers shows their customer unfriendly attitude.
