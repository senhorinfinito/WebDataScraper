2. staff can smile a bit more and be more courteous. though they were helpful and nice but a bit of smile can add to good experience specially coming from UK where greeting and thanking is so much in culture. it felt odd when you were not greeted properly while entering

However, when we got into the plane and learned that our seats were (18J and 18K) aisle seats; not the bassinet compatible ones.
We demanded the bassinets. Those compatible seats were assigned to two adults and a 10 - 12 year old boy. I told them it was impossible to travel 15 hr holding little babies on our lab and shoulder. They called people on the ground to fix it. One person came in and admonished us to travel the way the seats were assigned as we were standing. We tried to convince from humanitarian point of view. We insisted for the bassinets, of course. He said he did not care whether we had babies or not; bassinets cannot be guaranteed. He threw his powerful weapon i.e. threatening us to remove from the plane and instructed from his woki toki to remove our baggage. He could have negotiated those three passengers easily but did not bother. You decide for your journey!"

Being an Indian we are using the services of Air India frequently, but the real appreciation for our national airline i.e. Air India, developed in our hearts after we compared it with BA and AA. Among these three airlines, AA was the worst as there was zero hospitality, poor or no in-flight entertainment facilities, excessive delay, no food services even in 7 to 8 hrs flights, poor management by ground staff, faces of cabin staff gave a clear indication that we the customers are unwelcome lot, overall it was an extremely frustrating experience. BA was better as compared to AA but still no match for Air India. In our trip we were really missing Air India and by god's grace, as our Miami - London AA flight was delayed, we were shifted from BA to Air India for London - Delhi sector and we were so happy, and as always Air India surpassed our expectations in terms of punctuality, hospitality and in-flight entertainment facilities. In AA flight no one served us water whereas in Air India we were served water, drinks, snacks, meals as many times as we wanted. This time we could distinctly realize that we never appreciate our own things and madly appreciate others whereas the facts are entirely different."

Worst Customer Service Policy Ever,"On a once in a lifetime trip to India, my family and I had the misfortune to have been booked on an Air India flight from Varanasi to Mumbai. The original flight could not take off due to a technical fault and needed a new part to be delivered. We were given tickets for a flight to New Delhi where were due to land and then catch a connecting flight an hour later to Mumbai. A huge inconvenience, but with no other option we accepted it.
Then, having issued us tickets to this Delhi flight, the Air India staff decided to delay the flight to Delhi, and use the plane that was meant for Delhi to take everyone from the Mumbai flight to Mumbai. Their solution to one delayed/cancelled flight was to delay/cancel a second one. However, to make matters worse, they had given us tickets to the flight they delayed moments before they decided to delay it and send it to the very place we were originally trying to go! In a display of unbelievable incompetency, they failed to bother to tell us they had done this until we figured it out ourselves by which time they informed us they were very sorry but they couldn't let us board the flight as it was too late. (At this time, it was still in the airport and connected to the terminal building walkway but apparently someone had completed their paperwork and despite being able to cancel and invent a new flight out of nowhere, it would be impossible to change paperwork!)
Of course, this also now meant that we would be stranded for another 3-4 hours while we waited for the flight to go to Mumbai and back AND we had obviously missed the connecting flight from Delhi that they had said we should catch!
Putting to one side how completely ridiculous and incomprehensible it is to me that an organisation can display such incompetence, my real frustration has occurred since. The last flights out of Delhi would have left prior to our arrival there due to these new additional delays meaning Air India had now given us tickets for something they physically could no longer deliver, 100% down to their own fault. (it's also worth noting our original flight was around 1pm and now at something like 6 or 7pm we were still in Varanasi airport trying to resolve this.
We were promised by the Air India manager on duty that if we cancelled our flights with them and bought new flights from another airline (Spice Jet) directly to Mumbai, given they could no longer provide the service we had paid for they would refund our tickets AND refund the Spice Jet tickets.
Having returned to the UK I emailed them to request all of this along with further claims of disruption and cancelled hotel costs that we could not make. After several months of chasing, emailing and then chasing again I finally had a reply saying they would refund my tickets. Only the Air India ones though because they didn't have the authority to refund other things. That was over a month ago. I have requested details of management trying to speak to someone with the authority to discuss my claim but I get no answer (which is reflective of how Air India have treated me since the beginning). Furthermore, a month later I still haven't even received the refund that they promised to give me in writing and every email I send requesting confirmation of this is ignored. The airline staff in the airport were laughing at the situation to our faces at how ""unlucky"" this all was, despite being the very people who caused the whole thing. My experience of Air India is that their entire customer service team from the very top to the very bottom is beyond appalling and no-one in the company cares even the slightest amount about their customers. I would warn anyone about using this company and advise never to do it."

They change their flight schedules at their whimps and fancies moments before travel, with least consideration to customer service and satisfaction. Imagine, when you have a domestic flight and then a connecting international flight, they change the International flight schedules after you are on board the domestic one !! The ordeal does not end here. Then they have no clue, even the duty manager at airport, regarding the rescheduled flight. Their answer is - ""We have no answer at this point"". This statement comes when you are 2 hrs away from your rescheduled departure time.

This is not the first time I have seen this and faced. Earlier, they rescheduled and pre-poned a flight 4 hrs before and I had no clue. I had to catch two different connecting flights to catch my International one, being thirsty and hungry for more than 12 hrs and AI din't even care for any customer service nor even someone from them had a word ! This was a year before and I thought AI is improving and would be better next time !!

One of the air hostess was nearly the age of my mom, and she behaved liked one, shouted on passengers and made faces. Do not ask them for food change or anything, they would literally insult you. The second part of horror started with Delhi to Melbourne. The dream liner was so beautiful and spacious, you would never find so much space between seats in any other flight.

It's a special route.thank you air India only you flies between this route :)
First of all I was very lucky to be able to book an airfare sale offer ticket by Air India in thier New year or May be diwali sale.
The average ticket price on this route remains rupees 5500 but I got it for rupees1700(In sale).But as I know most of the other travelers paid more than 5000 rupess , I would review it keeping that in mind . For an air distance of just 300 miles , delhi to kullu , paying a price , for which you can actually book a delhi to dubai flight is strange .But the reason is that the bhuntar airport can't manage big planes so the 72 seater plane costs high per seat & on maintenance and running cost.
You get light breakfast including a sandwich,a muffin,tea,water bottle.
flight begins at 6:35 am reaches 7:50am.
Summary is that though its little costly,but it saves you from a 12 hour of bus journey ,plus the outside view of the himalayas is cool . so it's good if you have money spend it on this flight :) & pray more airlines start plying between this routes.
one flight daily delhi kullu , kullu delhi .

, I travelled in Air India . Unlike other cramped airlines , often Air India has beautiful seating arrangement , seats are large and broad, spacious enough to accommodate even the heavier people and I had three in my entourage. The point is they were all happy beyond description after they reach Ahmedabad. I noticed that it's often less crowded, and luggage free allowed is 25 kgs , really astounding. Air hostesses are clad chic in yellow and red sarees greeting you with namaskar and namasthe. Our journey was two-fold . Coimbatore to Mumbai was the first part and we reached Termminal B. We didn't need to shift the luggage , it's auto transit. We have to walk at least half kilometer to check into the international terminal where we checked in to another Airline which came from New York. This was called the 'Dreamliner' the mega boeing of Air India . We were served meals and tea two times . The air trip was quiet nice and joyous. NOWADAYS AIR INDIA HAS IMPROVED A LOT WITH REGARD TO PUNCTUALITY . So it's always better to travel in the nations aircraft.

However to my delight the boarding started at 1200h and I was very happy. But once entering the aircraft I realised that the APU (Auxilary Power Unit) which also keeps the airconditioning ON on ground was not working and the aircraft was very very hot and humid. The mandatory pre-flight briefing was cut short by the captain who annouced that we will be taking off immediately and asked to flight crew to take their seats! And we took off immediately.

For such a long flight (Port Blair - Visakhapatnam - New Delhi) there was no in-flight entertainment and certainly no meals. Only two pieces of sandwiches and a juice. The air hostess was also in hurry who was almost tossing the packet!

The aircraft landed early at Visakhapatnam and the passengers who boarded were also taken by surprise at the lack of airconditioning on ground. A senior air hostess upon boarding the aircraft, rudely asked a passenger who was sitting in the front row- A, to move to the window seat so that she could keep her bag. In return she also got a rude NO from the passenger! Taken by surprise, the air hostess repeated 'No? you wont move?' and the passenger re-affirmed NO!! Nice entertainment indeed.

A couple of the passengers who boarded at Visakhapatnam asked for feedback performa and started filling it up. One even asked other passengers to fill it up, which was heared by one of the senior air hostess. She reprimanded the passenger for inciting others and after that they were heated arguments. Luckily it was again interrupted by the captain who said we were taking off and lo.. we were on the air again.

After sometime we were again given two peices of sandwich and a juice. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The aircraft reached New Delhi control at 1700h, at least one hour early! I was really happy but fate had other plans. New Delhi was experiencing Thunder Showers and dust storm and the aircraft was put on a holding pattern by the Control. After a while the captain announced that the weather was bad and all (including air crew) to take seats and fasten their seat belts.

What followed was one of the worst buffeting I experienced in my 20 odd years of flying. The aircraft was literally tossed up and down and many of the passengers really freaked out. The one to be freaking out the most was was the senior air hostess! She was literally screaming prayers to different gods!! I had been thinking that it was their (air hostess) job to comfort the passengers. But this one was scaring other passengers real bad!! God knows how she has been kept in service.

Finally after more than an hour, the captain broke clouds and expertly landed the aircraft. All were safe and happy.

A few passengers who were harping on complaining on landing (about the non-functional airconditioners) were very happy to be on ground - alive again, collected their luggage and vanished into thin air."

This is a normal phenomena in this airline in all sectors. On-time performance is by exception only. Best is to avoid it, unless one does not have any choice left."

In flight experience was amazing. The Dreamliner has very good in-flight entertainment, Every seat has separate led screen which is fully loaded with Marathi, Hindi, English Movies, Comedy shows, songs and many more. Most amazing thing is we can track our flight on map realtime.
On board food quality is superb. They serve best quality scotch in international flight.
Really enjoy the flying experience with Air India.
Thank you very much Star Alliance - Air India."

If you are travelling to Mumbai and if your Air India flight says International Terminal, then one word of advice, be prepared for extra long hours for check-out. All said and done the Airline has really upgraded their flight updates compared to a few years ago, however there are many counts on which they lag drastically. In-flight dining experience really sucks, the stewards are the typical no-smiling characters that appear on the sidelines and do mostly nothing. It is this idiotic experience of landing in the International Terminal and trying to decipher your way out of the terminal and show your boarding passes a multiple times at the various check-points. I don't know where the finger actually points, at the GVK airport or at the Airlines. This is due to the fact that at the International Terminal the way out is through the duty free shop. One pointer...look for the floor signs as in a parking lot for your way out. Also, be prepared to be wowed by the scents and the sights greeting you on your way out. If you have the stomach for digesting temptation in all forms :-) For someone who wants to find the easiest way to get off the flight, find their luggage and hop into a cab (that's affordable and does not rip you) ...the whole experience was a long stretched nightmare...into 4 hours only to get out that damned building. GVK really needs to work on this customer experience.

One another tip about Air India. Ours was a late night flight which was delayed due to factors beyond the Airlines control. However, the only food served on board was a half cheese sandwich...the kids travelling on the airlines were hungry as hell and being late night all the restaurants at the airport were closed. Someone, somewhere so a little humanity please...all in all a real nightmare for me as I am a very keen observer of customer delight. This one needs a way lot of work!"

Hard to find on this leg of the journey but let me think hard...................hmmmm the journey ended after 12 hours in flight

Negatives:
Where do I start? Okay start with the boarding, perfectly Indian and chaotic, nobody had the patience to be in Q.
Flight departed late as the as the incoming aircraft was late and the boarding made it worse and arrived late in Delhi too (standard thing across most AI flights).
The in-flight entertainment was not working, so they changed my seat from a window to middle.
The seat had a better width and pitch but the cushioning was not comfortable and the second seat I was allocated had push-back problem.
The in-flight meal service was fast but started a bit late
On this flight they had one beer per person quota
The toilets were literally unusable (after about four hours in to the flight) as they were stinking people on this flight had no concern for their co-passengers.
Although the air-hostess/host were screaming not to do so, the passengers started getting up from their seat as soon as the flight touched down (even it had not exited the main runway) and were carelessly opening the overhead storage, actually saw a bag falling from it on to a seated passenger.\
And...........................the list just goes ON

Finally I was free from the captivity of AI 301."

Passenger travelling on Alliance Air to Air India or vice versa would be allowed Free Baggage Allowance of 25 Kgs per passenger per flight.
For journey applicable only on Alliance Air Flights (Aircraft types - CRJ / ATR 42) FBA would continue to be restricted to 15 Kgs.

After finding the flight I wanted, I looked everywhere and read all of the fine print. I didn't see any information about what kind of aircraft I would be on. It is very important for me to be allowed 25 kgs because I am going on to an international flight. However, AFTER I bought the ticket, I was informed that the baggage allowance was only 15 kgs.
I emailed the company and complained. They did nothing. They refuse to increase the baggage for me. This is unacceptable customer service. How can a person make an informed decision without being informed?"

Being on time wasn't an expectation with AI and it never will be. Its not something they strive to achieve, and nor do they care. Both the flights were delayed severely.
Though I had booked seat numbers during booking via the AI website, and had it printed on ticket, they changed it for some illogical reason during checkin..then whats the point ?
No assistance for women with infants during boarding, they're also expected to crowrd-board as others.
The aircraft was from a previous era, seats smeared with food, a newspaper that was read 100 times and stuffed in the pockets, torn fabric, hand marks here and there etc. The seat mounted AV systems was a showpiece only.
Food was sad..very sad..rice and the veg smelled like made from old ingredients. Salad was probably a week old, dry and dead.The sweet dish (Rajbhog in AI266) was expired (being a foodie bengali I am qualified enough to differentiate between these goods and bads ). Tea/Coffee was served in metal jugs that we'd see in roadside restaurants (no they were not costly antiques)
The inflight announcements seemed to be very angry and the cabin crew did not know how to smile or make the travelers feel comfortable. Very very cold interpersonal skills.
Toilets were dirty, which wasn't a surprise.

The only saving grace was the legroom in economy and the somewhat empty aircraft, which allowed us to use the middle seat for our little one.

And Air India is supposed to our official airlines..huh!"
