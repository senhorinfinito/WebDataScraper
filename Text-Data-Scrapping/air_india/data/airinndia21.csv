And most importantly nobody can match the food and hospitality of air india crew. My experience in foreign airlines has been pretty bitter. The crew of air india is polite and their food is good in every which way."

Economy",On good wings,"in august 2016 i flew with air india from melbourne to frankfurt via new delhi. well, this is quite a long journey; and the prospect of having to hang around at indira gandhi international airport for 19 hours waiting for the connecting flight, could easily deter one from booking with air india, right? BUT: the airfare was so cheap that even with paying for a stay at the holiday inn express in terminal 3 (transit area!) it was a very reasonable - and because of the break - very enjoyable trip.

the most important thing during the flight itself was (#1) excellent leg room. the second good thing (#2) was the very nice (although and as to be expected, a bit spicy) food. the third treat (#3) was the inflight entertainment selection - including yoga and indian cooking videos and a highly recommendable beautifully dramatized (abridged) audio version of mahatma gandhi's autobiography 'the story of my experiments with truth' (i wish i could find this particular one on the internet). # 4 would be that all flights were on time.

what i liked less - even as the airline seems to be very proud of it - is one feature of the B787 dreamliner: the dimmable windows instead of pull-down shutters. it is not that the feature itself is the problem, but that very early in the flight the staff already dimmed down the windows in the whole plane, no matter what time of the day! i found this highly annoying for two reasons: first of all, it messes even more with time (and related light/dark) differences. second, because i LOVE taking pictures during flights (and i am certainly not the only one to do so), i choose my window seat carefully in regards to being able to include a bit of the wing in some of the images to frame them, and most important, which side of the plane i would be able to witness a sunrise or sunset or see any beautiful mountain ranges, deserts, islands or other sights of interest in the areas over which we would be flying. now, when calling for the stewardess, she said she can certainly unlock my window dimmer so that i can regulate it myself, which saved my mood and allowed me to take breathtaking images once again... (on the longer leg of the return flight i sat in an over-crowded plane in a place where the dimmer happened to be broken... no pictures... but as this is not a main concern for most people, i rather focus on - and review - the good experience;-)"

When we landed in Chennai and went for the baggage claim to our notice the bag was treated so badly that the fragile sticker got torn and our bag got torn. Though nothing inside was damaged as we had stuffed it with a lot of towels inside.
This review is just for people to know that the baggage handling especially of this aircraft crew is not at all good. It would be better to carry your baggage which would have fragile items either in the cabin or stuff it with something to protect it because""AIR INDIA DOES NOT CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY OF ANY BROKEN OR DAMAGED CHECK-IN BAGGAGE"".

Though the baggage in the photo doesn't seem much damaged but there is always a ""WHAT IF?""

My outgoing flight on was excellent food was great, the flight attendant, a young chap, very friendly and pleasant. I had a connecting flight to Goa which I was concerned about missing due to delays but the attendant put my mind at rest - great service.

Returning to the UK was a totally different story. The flight attendant was an older lady who looked very tired and had a very 'cant be bothered' air about her. She was rude and ignored me when I couldn't access the seat tray. I ate the first tray of food served and felt quite queasy after it so didn't have the next tray offered. The next day I suffered from the worst stomach upset for over a week and spent three days in bed."

The air craft to Newark needed renovation, the seats would creak through out, my food tray was broken so you could not have your meals properly and the TV screen was not working. I must have told the flight attendants thrice about the TV screens and every time she said it will be done in 20 minutes, it never happened - the flight duration is 18 hours so I was highly bored and irritated by the time we landed.
I am a very tolerant and calm traveler but this flight has made me a little cautious of travelling with Air India."

Business Class",Delayed; Disgusting Interior,"I had high expectations for this segment of a round-the-world trip my husband and I were taking, based on my excellent history of flights with Air India years ago. Instead, this flight proved to be the worst of our journey. Indeed, I would put it near the bottom of all the airlines that I've been on during decades of flying.

The plane was scheduled to depart from Bahrain, en route to New Delhi India, at 11 p.m. Close to boarding time, we learned that there would be an hour's delay with no reason given. We went to wait in a small airlines lounge, which became uncomfortably crowded with standing room only. Eventually the delay got extended (still no explanation) and the plane finally departed at 2 a.m., three hours late.

As we boarded the plane, the condition of the exterior indicated no pride of ownership. The Airbus 319 had been sloppily painted, an indication of poor upkeep that I had never seen on any other carrier before. This situation did not improve inside. The Business Class cabin offered soiled seats that looked so unappealing that I wished I carried a towel with me to offer protection. As soon as I sat down, I noted the overflowing seat pockets on the back of the seats in front of us. Trash included old newspapers and candy wrappers. After the plane took off, I tried to recline my seat, only to find that it was broken.

Extremely tired and definitely not hungry, both my husband and I declined the meal service, so I cannot comment on that. The plane made the strangest noises throughout the 3.5-hour flight, creaking, groaning and causing me to feel anxious, though I am usually a calm flier. As a result, I could not sleep. When I went to use the Business Class restroom, I noted the two flight attendants dozing. My shoes stuck to the restroom floor -- literally -- making loud crackling noises when I moved around, but that didn't awaken staff.

We arrived too late to make a connecting flight to Jaipur, which we had allowed almost 4 hours to do. So we waited for 3 hours in the airport at a wonderfully clean Starbucks with a pristine restroom before we were able to take to the air again."

thanks

this horrified tale is my firsthand experience during our family trip (me, my wife and 4 ys old son) to hyderabad from jodhpur on 7th April. We had booked for IA flight jodhpur to mumbai AI 646 and connecting flight AI 965 from mumbai to hyd for 7th April.

I had done the webcheckin for our seats even for the mumbai - hyd sector. when we reached at the jodhpur airport upon seeing the boarding pass we realised the onward flight from mumbai to hyderbad has been rescheduled to next day. (obviously no one informed us till then). Since my family was travelling to attend a family engagement in the evening of 7th, the next day flight made no sense hence we requested the AI executives at jodhpur to either cancel the tickets or make arrangements in another flight. The AI jodhpur did connect to their counterparts in mumbai and spoke with someone by name Stefan who assured that we shall be provided any alternate flight either AI or Jet for mumbai to hyd so that we can reach hyd by the evening hence should continue with our travel to mumbai and were asked to reach to the customer service desk in mumbai who would make necessary arrangements (a message was already sent)

At mumbai we went to the customer service desk and we were guided to one Ms Rama, who after keeping us waiting for 15 min and upon our multiple requests spoke with someone and then issued us tickets and asked us to rush in towards the boarding gate no 50 as she said the flight was about to leave. We again checked in our bag and ran towards the boarding gates .. (since it was the international airport, we had to run towards the boarding gates as it was a very long distance. upon reaching the boarding gate no 50 the AI staff informed that the onboarding flight is for jeddah and the flight to hyd is yet to be announced and we were asked to wait.

We sat near the boarding gates .. it was around 3.30 pm by then. After waiting for about an hour or so, and trying to figure out the flight schedule i just noticed that the boarding pass issued to me altough dated 7th of April has a flight timing of 04.00 hours which obviously refers to morning 4 am and thanks to the urgency shown by Ms Rama i didnt notice it when collected the boarding pass and assumed it for 4 pm evening.

I immediately contacted an AI official near the boading gate Mr. Kumar and narrated our story, he tried to help us by making a few calls and then explained that the lady has done mistake in issuing the boarding passes and she has given you boarding passes for the same flight which is suppose to leave tomorrow (8th April) and erroneously the date mentioned is for today (7th April). He then asked us to go again to the counter and ask for a new boarding pass.

we left, then were caught by the customs officers (rightly so) ... then again the whole story was narrated to them. They also sympathized, but said they cant let us go back from the immigration zone unless AI officers come here. They called AI officers ... after waiting for about 15-20 min AI officers turned up and then they explained the situation did some notings .. cancelled our boarding passes and then guided us again to the counters .... so again after a long walk back ... (by this time our baby had already gone restless and with lots of efforts we could manage to walk him back till the counters)

We reached back to the counter at 6.00 pm and again met Ms Rama ... i told her my agony and complained who could she issue a wrong boarding pass .. for the same flight which is leaving tomorrow .. that too after informing you the complete story ... to my surprise inspite of apologizing for the mix up and the problem faced by us, she started misbehaving and she said .... ""i did what i was told to you and it is your mistake that you came to my counter, this is a domestic counter your ticket is in the international flight, you should have gone to the international counter"" .... i was stunned with the response and was so upset and wanted to give her back on her face for the rude, in-appropriate and irresponsible behavior .... may be my chivalry stopped me and the fact that i was perturbed by my child's agony that i decided just to move back and go to the international counter ( altough it did occur to me then, that may be the recent incident involving trashing of an AI staff by a politician for some seat issue could have been justified at some level - unfortunately in a democratic set-up only politicians have the luxury to react that way ... a common man can just suffer)

i then moved to the international counter it was 6.15 by then. I met Mr. Kailash at the counter. He was a soft spoken person, listed patiently to the whole story and apologized for the inconvenience and promised us to help us, We waited for about 15-20 min and at about 6.30 pm he came back and said, i have spoken to my boss and also spoken with the duty manager (he named Mr. Revan and Mr. Gaikwad) and they have authorised him to book us into the next available flight, but since no other flight is available we can put us into the 10 pm flight (AI 050) for Hyderabad, i requested that i was promised any other airlines if AI is not available so that i can reach hyd on time .. but Mr. Kailash mentioned that no other flights are available so you have the choice to either take this flight or take the morning flight and stay at mumbai. ... obviously our plan to attend the family function was gone atleast i was relieved that we can reach hyd by the night and i shall be able to attend a business conference at morning 10 am, hence agreed for the AI 050 flight. ( i was a guest speaker at the Hyd RenewX - conference on renewable energy and was speaker participants in a panel discussion scheduled for 10 am on 8th April)

Since my child was exhausted and so were we .. we decided to take the night flight and may be relax at the airport till then. I asked Mr. kailash to provide us atleast a lounge access so that we can relax till we waitup for the next flight. To which he refused as there is no such policy :-( ... anyhow we decided to manage things on our own and asked Mr. Kailash to issue boarding passes for the 10 pm flight and this is when we inquired about our checked in baggages which Ms Rama has taken from us earlier in the afternoon.

Mr. Kailash inquired about the bags and he said ... he has already cordinated and the bags are being retreived and they will be put AI 050 aircraft so we should not worry and proceed towards security check.

We took the boarding passes at about 6.50 and proceeded for the security check.. hoping that the things are now sorted and it was just a bad day ... to be forgotten.

But AI had other plans for us, we reached at the boarding zone at about 9.30 pm but to our dismay flight for hyd was yet to be announced. We kept on waiting near the boarding gate hoping for some info from the officials as to the flight status ,,,,... together with several other impatient passengers we kept on inquiring but were getting no response on the flight for hyd.

Finally we were told that the flight will leave at about 11 pm ...11 pm past still noting ,,,,,, finally the flight arrived and got scheduled at 00.15 hours for hyd. Already impressed with the service standards of AI, i asked the AI ground staff to confirm if my bags have been loaded in this aircraft..... to which the staff checked and assured me that your bags are already loaded. happy that finally the ordeal is over, we boarded the flight which might have flown out of mumbai around 1 am.

We reached Hyd at 2 am and after scouting from belts to belts we finally realised that our bags are missing. ...at about 2.30 we approached the baggage section and they checked into the systems and said our bags were not loaded by mumbai and will arrive in the morning flight and will be delivered to your address.

That was it, perhaps the only time when i must have lost my cool in the whole day. .... but it was of no use as the AI staff like any government servant have no sense of job responsibility neitto w morning you should call after 9.30 am .. (gave me a number to call at) and the person will tell you about the status. .... exhausted, helpless, disappointed and disparaged, with long faces we left the airport at 3.15 am for the 5 star hotel we booked and wasted the days booking money.

Upon reaching the hotel i realised about my morning conference and how on earth was it possible to get business cloths by 9 am in morning to make it to the conference which again was other side of the town from where we were staying. Left with no option i wrote an email to the conference organizers notifying them with a last minute withdrawal and with all my apologies for the inconvenience ... yes a common man has the courtesy and courage to apologize, unlike these government servants.

we checked into our room at 4.30 am and slept thinking how difficult the day was on us ... and how shattered our plans were by the end of the day. Apart from the inconvenience caused to my family ... we couldnt make it to the family function, i had to skip my conference meeting, we wasted the money on hotel booking and are sleeping here with no luggage. ..... what a day.

When someone would say .. now what wrong can happen ... the AI has few more to offer ... [ i dont know about anyone who is reading this, but i myself am getting tired writing about it any further, so would cut the further ordeal in short]

after atleast 50 calls (including few people who stopped picking my phone and had to request hotel team to call on my behalf) and hearing to 5 different stories (obviously with false information) i could finally reach to one Mr. Sharat (040 66603056) at 4.30 pm in the evening and he told me all the people whom you have spoken so far have given you false stories about our baggages ... your bags have now left mumbai and will arrive here at hyd at 6 pm. I will personally make sure that the bags are cleared out on priority and we shall send them to you by today itself thru our logstics partner Mr. Joshi / Mr Sainath He also gave me Mr. Joshi's/Sainath's number. Who confirmed to me of my bags at 7.30 and finally delivered them to my hotel at 10 pm in the night.,........ in the afternoon, when i had demanded for some compensation to buy new cloths (i was told that the other airlines has this policy) the baggage section people refused saying we dont have any policy for such payments and at max we can go out and shop what you need, Send us the bills, we will examine and let you know, the maximum amount we can pay is Rs 500.

I complained at various forums and am yet to receive any feedback"

I flew Air India and Indian Airlines back in the 80s/90s and it was a bit chaotic. But this trip was absolutely fine. It's comfortable and only four of the 24 biz seats were filled on my way out. Staff polite and competent unlike some BA battle-axes i've come across. The food was perfectly OK and the Dreamliner is great step forward. And it probably cost 50% less than the BA Club fare. Only drawback the ten mile walk to passport control at Terminal 2.

This one day was a particularly stressful one, with flights getting cancelled due to fog. Almost all airlines struggled, but Air India failed spectacularly. Long and short of the story is that the flight that was supposed to take off at 8pm, was finally cancelled at 4am the next morning. In addition, the passengers, who were agitated after they got to know that their crew was diverted to a flight which had a VIP on board and cancelled as a result, were baton-charged by airport security at the behest of Air India officials. Acceptance set in, but getting the AI persons at the airport counter were hurling abuses on harassed passengers. Anyway, I finally booked a Jet Airways flight and vowed never to take Air India again. Lesson learnt."

Economy",The Never Ending Terror Of Air India,"I would like to start off by telling all readers what a disgrace Air India is to India, Indians and its passengers. I would like to share a recent experience that I had with Air India during my travel to India.

The nightmare started on Tuesday, April 18. I had come to India because of a sudden death in my family and I was scheduled to return to the US on April 18. My return flight was scheduled from Ahmedabad to Delhi and then Delhi to JFK, New York. Please note that this flight was full and consisted of about 300 passengers, majority of whom were elderly people (on wheel chairs) as well as numerous children.

The level of incompetence showed by Air India during this flight is unimaginable. It is even more difficult to digest the fact that these people who are working for Air India represent India and Indians worldwide. What a shame! What a disgrace! Not just for the Air India team but the Indian government in general. Given that this is a “government” airline these fools thinks they can get paid without doing any work!

The following events took place at the Delhi Airport on between Tuesday, April 18 and Wednesday, April 19:

1: 30 AM (Inside Air India Flight) - All passengers were boarded on to the flight as the flight was supposed to take off at 1:45 AM.

2:00 AM (Inside Air India Flight) – The AC inside the flight was switched off. Current temperature in Delhi: 100 °C +.

2:15 AM (Inside Air India Flight) - One of the captains announced that they were experiencing some delays due to “technical difficulties” and that we are expected to take off in 12 - 15 minutes.

2:30 AM (Inside Air India Flight) – Passengers are walking around the cabin, picking up magazines to use as a fan. Kids are screaming because of the heat, exhaustion and lack of sleep.

Between 2:30 – 3:00 PM (Inside Air India Flight) – One of the crew members announces that all passengers are going to have to get off the plane.

All passengers stood up, got their carry on’s and waited patiently for the door to open. 10 minutes later, the same crew member announces “All passengers please get back to your assigned seats” and no other information…

3:30 AM (Inside Air India Flight) - Once hour later the flight stood exactly where it was without any announcements or information from the crew members regarding the further delay. When I decided to approach one of the crew members asking what the problem was, their response “ We don’t know maam so we don’t know what to tell you”.

Between 3:30 – 4:00 PM (Inside Air India Flight) – Once again, one of the crew member announces that all passengers are going to have to get off the plane. All passengers stood up, got their carry on’s and waited patiently for the doors to open. Within a few minutes , the same crew member announces “All passengers please get back to your assigned seats” and ONCE AGAIN providing NO other information…

4:00 AM (Inside Air India Flight) - Two and half hours into this nightmare as the heat became unbearable some of the passengers requested that Air India let people back into the terminal while they waited. One of the people requesting this was a mother carrying her child who was suffering with fever while another passenger was a diabetic patient. Air India refused this request and after some heated arguments with passengers they finally opened the airline door so the passengers could wait in the aerobridge area that connects the flight and terminal. See pictures.

5:00 AM (Inside Air India Flight) - FINALLY! They decided they were going to let people on to the terminal. Their reasoning for this – We are going to fly another plane to JFK so all passengers will have to change flights.

6:00 AM (Inside Terminal) – After almost five hours’ worth of wait, someone from Air India at the Delhi Airport tells a handful of passengers that this flight is being CANCELLED. After being asked by several people to SPEAK UP and INFORM ALL PASSENGERS OF THE CHANGE this man finally made an announcement.

Reasoning for cancellation – the crew’s shift is over and they have left so there is no one who can fly the plane (Are you serious?). The next flight will depart to JFK today evening at 5PM AND in the meantime all passengers are being taken to a hotel WHICH IS ONE HOUR AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT (Again, Are you SERIOUS?!?). All passengers will need to COLLECT THEIR LUGGAGE and CANCEL THEIR IMMIGRATION to they can take the evening flight.

6:30 AM (Delhi Airport) – I have decided I am not going to a random hotel. Given the lack of disorganization that Air India has shown tonight I do not trust that the evening flight will depart. I decided to purchase an Emirates ticket for a flight to JFK which was departing at 11:00 AM instead.

After cancelling my immigration I asked an Air India representative what the process was if I wanted to get back bags back. She asked me to go upstairs to the second floor to the Air India counter and ask them for my bags.

When I reached the Air India counter on the second floor, the man at the counter said he cannot help me and that I need to go to the baggage check in counter for Air India and they will provide my bags. So I go there. The female staff at this counter tells me “I don’t know anything about this flight”. Then I ask a third person and explain my situation that the flight was cancelled and I have another flight at 11:00 AM, whose check in will close at 10:00 AM so I need my bags. This man finally tells me that he can get my bags but it’s going to take them 4 HOURS. By now it is 7:00 AM and my check in with emirates was going to close at 10:00 AM leaving me 3 hours to get my bags back.

Given my lack of time, the male staff I was speaking with calls a female staff to assist. Once again, she gives me the same excuses that the other person did. By this point, I have had no sleep, no food and no rest. I tell her “I don’t care that the process says you need 4 hours, I only have 3 hours and I don’t want to miss my next flight so PLEASE atleast TRY to get my bags”. At this she says “Maam if you don’t care then I can’t help you” and WALKS AWAY!

ARE YOU SERIOUS? Where do these people get SO much ego from? Aren’t we as Indians supposed to be kind hearted? Aren’t we supposed to help each other in need? What do these staff members get paid for? Why do they even get a salary? And why are they not fired already? Oh! That’s right – it's a government agency where it is almost impossible to fire people. So here we are, stuck having to deal with absolute IDIOTS!

Finally, after repeatedly pleading to the other staff member one of the on floor managers came to me. He said they would try his best to get my bags and takes my passport. Given how frustrated I was by this point I didn’t think twice before giving him my passport. BIG MISTAKE – DO NOT GIVE YOUR PASSPORT TO ANY AIR INDIA STAFF MEMBERS!

This floor manager gives my passport to one of his workers and sends him to retrieve my bags.

8:30 AM (Air India Counter) – Can you check to see if they founds my bags? Their reply – yes, he is completing paperwork and will be back in an hour.

9:00 AM (Air India Counter) – Can you check to see if they are on their way? Their reply – yes, he is on the way.

9:30 AM (Air India Counter) – Can you check to see if he is almost here, my check in closes in 30 minutes? Their reply – yes, he is almost here.

9:45 AM (Next flight check in closing at 10:00 AM) – The floor manager calls the guy who is out retrieving my bags. The on floor manager tells me “Looks like they have the wrong bags”….

This was the moment I lost all faith, in this Airline, their staff and the Indian Government! I think at this point it is ok to say that it’s not the individual agencies who are 100% incompetent. It is the Indian Government who is incompetent.

9:55 AM (Air India Counter) - NOW, the on floor manager tells me – why don’t you take the emirates flight, we will send your luggage on the next Air India flight to JFK. Again, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? If this was an option, why did you not let me do this when I had initially asked if my bags could be delivered directly to JFK? Oh my goodness, I mean the level of STUPIDITY Air India!

10:00 AM (Emirates Counter) – Emirates was ready to close their check in counter. I pleaded and they agreed that they would wait 10 more minutes for me. By now you must be wondering – well the guy fetched the wrong bags so what were you still waiting for?

Well, MY PASSPORT!

While I am pleading emirates to keep their counter open, the Air India guy is on his phone saying that we cannot find the guy that has your passport…

Readers: Do you feel the anxiety? And the frustration? And the Anger by now?

10:15 AM (Emirates Counter) – The Air India Idiot who had my passport finally arrived and Emirates was kind enough to let me board the flight!!

For those who watch hindi movies – you know how in patriotic movies when they show a long time Indian prisoner being released from Pakistan gets to come home to India he drops to the ground with happiness. That was how I felt when my flight landed in JFK…

P.S: After returning home, Air India called 4 days later telling me that my bags would be delivered at night between 11:30 PM and 1:30 AM on a work night. When we called to ask for a refund, they told us to follow up with the Ahmedabad office!!! The nightmare just DOESN’T END!!!

For all readers / travelers considering Air India: Please, please, please, unless you have no other options please travel by a better airline instead of using Air India. My husband and I had no choice when we booked our flights, we booked the first flight to India upon receiving news of a death in our family."

But all was good right from the check in at the counter to getting in the aircraft. Even the leg room was much better and comfortable. Thats it - after take off - not so impressive. Even if their food is good the service is useless and team was not helpful at all.

The airline offers a wide range of choices for domestic flights and allows 25kg checked bag allowance which worked well for us as we were carrying all our bags with us. The flight costs were reasonable but that's where the good points end. The flight attendants were surly and looked so fed up, on both flights. The worst part of was the lack of any system for boarding flights. As soon as boarding was announced, there was a free for all with passengers shoving and pushing despite have a designated seats and boarding cards. The airline staff made no effort to control the boarding and stood looking bored and disinterested. Has to be the worst airline I've ever experienced."

Check-in was fine (I'm a *A Gold card so I was able to use the business queue in DEL). Lounge facilities were basic but more than adequate for a domestic flight.

Boarding was a complete mess (as is the case in India) I had to force my way to the front of the queue for Priority boarding

The aircraft was unbelievably warm throughout the flight. Several passengers complained about the cabin temperature and were told that there was nothing that could be done. My seat mate in 4B noticed that the arm rest was wobbly and when he attempted to put it down for take off, the entire armrest just collapsed. When he told the flight attendant about it, he was just simply told 'alright'.

Catering on this nighttime flight was fine. You get a full vegetarian dinner (rice, dal, paneer). It's much better then what you would get on any US carrier.

It was the right thing to do. However we ended up staying Ankara for 24 hours and received NO updates or information from Air India. We were herded like cattle into a narrow and cold departure lounge, guarded by airport security. Most of us were dressed for the heat of Mumbai, not the chill of an Ankara winter night. We were not allowed to leave this area, even those of us who did not need visas for Turkey. The Air India staff disappeared completely (taken to hotels) while we passengers were treated like sub-humans. The Turkish airport authorities provided us with food and they kept the washroom clean but Air India DID NOTHING. They did not even explain the reason for the delay. One of my travel companions was able to call a highly-placed relative in India who made a few calls and managed to find out what was happening and why we were delayed. This second hand information at least gave us some understanding of the situation. Air India should fire their entire communications staff and send all remaining staff to a communications course taught by people who understand that passengers do have some rights. This was a debacle from beginning to end. (And needless to say, AI offered no compensation to those of us who missed connecting flights, had to stay in hotels when we arrived in Mumbai, or suffered other inconveniences.)

During my current trip to Germany on 22nd Apr'17, I opted for Air India little reluctantly and out of compulsion. The first leg of the travel was with flight AI 21 from Kolkata to Delhi. Check in was smooth and fast luggage was booked directly to Frankfurt. Immigration was also done at Kolkata, which is always a better option than at Delhi. Post immigration , I was invited to the Travel Club Lounge for a quick breakfast. I selected seat 2B an aisle seat. Seat configuratuon was 2 2 2 . It was quiet spacious in the cabin with only 18 seats. Flight departed on time. It was a B 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The aircraft surprisingly looked worn out considering the fact that B 787 is a new aircraft. Welcome drink Virgin Mojito was very refreshing. Sandwiches and light brunch was served. Presentation of food was below par for Business Class. Coffee was served in crockery but instead of cutlery, cheap disposable plastic spoon was given. These small things make a lot of difference. Flight landed after 15 minute delay and I had to rush to Gate 13 which was quiet far. There was chaotic crowd at the transfer security check thanks to Delhi Airport. I manged to board my connecting flight 131 just on time. This was also a 787 Dreamliner. Flight was full. I had seat 1D an aisle seat of my choice. Interior of the aircraft is below par as compared to its Indian Peer Airlines or other European or Middle East Airlines. Seats was full flat but not to my expectation as a frequent business passenger. There was extreme lack of privacy in the seat alignment. Absolutely no plan to create storage of small acessories. Menu card was given. But no separate wine list in Business Class. So shocking. Flight took off on time. Non alcoholic welcome drink was offered. I went for coconut water. Flight entertaient system offered choice of Indian and western movies. Toilet in Business Class also looked sub standard to me. Lunch was served after take off. There was good choice in main course, I opted for Prawn Newburg served with persley potatoes and vegetables. Wine selection was very substandard. I asked for white wine with my prawns but they had ordinary Chaddonney and Bourdeaux. Quality was not upto the mark. I had to ask for comfort kit which was supposed to be given normally. While sleeping good duvet was made available. Before landing light snacks of kebabs and sandwiches was served. I ended my food with a glass of cognac. Flight landed on time and luggage was at the carousel before I reached there.
To sum up my experience , first with negatives : 1. Aircraft had pretty ordinary interior with compromised passenger comfort. Looks to be the cheapest within 787 class 2. Lack of privacy in the seat. They should have provided retractable privacy curtain 3. Food is not up to business class standard, presentation very poor 4. Worst choice of wine and alcoholic beverages 5. Toilet is very ordinary 6. No in-flight duty free shopping. 6. You do not feel of class and real business class flavor.
Now with positives : 1. Latest N787 Dreamliner aircraft 2. Good connectivity 3. Lands at T1 which is close to train station 4. Cheaper than its competitors by at least 10-15% 5. Through Check in and immigration at Kolkata.
My conclusion : Do take if you get at good bargain. You have to compromise real business class feel that you get in Emirates or Lufthansa or other middle east or European airlines.

Particularly my 8th trip with them was horrible, the ticketing staff at counter was very busy in her own task, it took almost 15 minutes to handover the boarding pass, as usual flight was delayed and no regrets, they were least bothered informing schedule change.
They give more importance to VIP guests, least bothered about economy class passengers, The aircraft was A319, boarding was quite smooth, onboard food was good. although they offer only vegetarian food, it was served hot,food was the only best part of entire journey, They offer more legroom compared to other domestic airlines of India.
Upon arrival at CSIA I found they misplaced my baggage, at 2.15pm there were no staff available at baggage handling dept. Finally one lady staff helped me to take complain of lost baggage, after completing entire formalities ground staff told me they have found my luggage. but the situation handled by AI staff was very pathetic.

The staffs were courteous and mostly attended promptly except one time where I had to keep pushing the button several times for a problem with the entertainment screen. The entertainment screens need serious inspection as it got hanged twice and it was really irritating.

It was a long haul dream liner flight from Delhi to room. I must admit that it was one of the most comfortable I have ever traveled. I did not feel so wrecked upon reaching the destination."

This trip was similar except that I had a business class seat that would not recline or raise. It was stuck in kind of an intermediate position. The entire crew tried to get it unstuck to no avail. The flight was full and so I had a 15+ hour flight with an expensive seat that did not work. Like before, the crew is friendly, the food is good (predominantly Indian fare), but the cleanliness and maintenance are FAR below what would be standard on a US or European carrier. Both international flights had many seat where bits were taped together (I am not exaggerating). I actually took a photo of my seat just to show friends ... Note: that this was not the only seat that looked like this. I will not use them again for business travel. They do cost less than other carriers (but I can see why)."

The staff weren't particularly attentive or friendly and when it came to meal time threw pre ordered vegetarian meals contained meat. This was at first denied by the staff member who served us until other passengers started complaining too and then vegetarian meals were provided. On the flight back we had requested 4 seats together or at least 2 couples together however we were all split up around the plane. The check in desk was chaos with people jumping queues and no communication from the staff. Check in took over an hour and the staff seemed to not no what was going on. When we finally got to the desk and were given out boarding passes we discovered that we had all been split up and complained. However there was no explanation and the check in lady serving us just stared blankly at us. We had about 10 minutes to get to the plane despite arriving three hours prior because two hours were taken up messing about at check in. The only redeeming part of this was a nice air steward on the plane who then tried to correct the mistakes that check in had made. He managed to seat people together as there were many empty seats so I can't understand what the issue was at check in. For the 9 hour flight there was hardly any water served. Generally a poor service I won't fly with them again."

Initially our booking was on Jet Airways, which we missed, thus looked for another booking, and air india was our best available option!
We were very hesitant but had to go on it as we had to be in Trivandrum on the same day.
Finding a booking was very easy, the Lady who gave us the booking at the Domestic Terminal ticketing desk was EXTREMELY helpful.
Checking in was smooth. We got 25 Kgs for baggage each, unlike other airlines who give only 15 Kgs per passenger ... so we saved a lot of money on excess baggage.

The flight departed on time, no delays. very sharp actually.
The flight was old, that I can say, and the walls and chairs weren't fresh and clean.

The leg room was amazingly big for an economy class, the chair was very comfortable.
The flight attendant was helpful.

The aircraft was at that time to be an ATR prop aircraft however closer to the time we were sent notification that the aircraft type and time were changing to a A320 & earlier departure time on Jan 14th 2017 . Check in was nice and easy at Delhi. Boarding aircraft was a reasonable affair. Aircraft was a STAR ALLIANCE branded plane instead of Air India. Seats were untidy and worn ,my seatbelt was frayed.
Take off was a bit late Service by crew was average ,you could tell that the male stewards just did not want to be on board this service. Breakfast was not too bad but not great either.but palatable. Flight itself was good but the landing in Surat was terrible. We landed so hard and the brakes went on even HARDER & FULL as we traveled along the runway, as the brakes came off we made a direct turn Right & off the runway which made me think the runway in Surat is not big enough to handle this A320 jet and we stopped just in time or that hard landing was too fast for this airstrip"

However do not make the mistake of booking your ticket on the Air India website. In the Airline's website the fare for our Kolkata- Rome and Milan-Kolkata flight in Oct2016 was quote for around Rs70,000 whether MakeMyTrip was quoting & Rs40000! Also do not book too much in advance in the MakeMyTrip sight. I had booked about two months in advance but nearer the time I found that the fare had dropped by another Rs2000. The flight to Rome was almost empty( however the flight from Milan to Delhi) was almost full.The aircraft was a Dreamliner and clean including the toilets. You must be aware that Air India provides one of the best leg room space.The service is efficient and food decent. The choice of drinks is good and the best part is that they do not even uncork the wine bottles so that they can carry them home. The only complaint is that the red wine was Sula, an Indian drink. The checkin smooth. The online entertainment is just decent but the choice of films should improve. However in Milan the Italian lady at the counter goofed up on our pre-booked seats on the Delhi- Kolkata sector. My wife and self were given seats in different rows. My mistake that I did not check the boarding pass. However a kind passenger helped us seat together.
Overall satisfactory flights which were all on time."

This is a 15 hour flight and we were counting on the entertainment system to help pass the time. I should have known something was wrong when my daughter's seat's screen would not respond to touch and three of the buttons on the handset were missing. This meant there was no way to change the volume! Anyway we somehow we both managed to start a movie. For both of us, after five minutes, and the system would reset making us start again over and over till we gave up after asking the stewardess for help three times. She claimed to have rebooted the system twice, to no avail. My husband's handset was completely dead. The staff, though polite, was helpless and laughing at the absurdity of the situation with me. I heard the stewardess tell the lady behind me that her system was not working eitehr. 15 hour flight, people!!
My tray table was broken and at an angle that it could not hold my food tray without sliding off. If you want an alcoholic beverage with your meal, your only option is wine and they don't offer it, rather you have to know and ask for it.
On the way back, the stewardess actually told me to come to the back and get wine if I wanted it. In 20 years of flying internationally, I have never been told that. On the 15 hour flight back, the restrooms were not cleaned once. They were filthy, in disarray, with supplies thrown all over the place."

2) No wifi - really. 16 hrs w/o Wifi.
3) 2/5 toilets didn't work in the back while coming back
4) And most of the time I couldn't hear what the captain was talking about. It was very hard to understand him
5) And oh yes. food is below average.

I am still intrigued by 16 hrs flight. but all of these issues scares me. it's a 777 flight but only 370 passengers so one good part is - you can get out faster. Most of the people who would prefer this flights are older parents and mom with small kids.

I really hope Air India would fix some of these issues. I'd one passenger who told me that this was his 3rd flight in last few months. And Air India has not made any improvements. I am not counting on any improvements."

We were able to check in online the day before, so all was good and we arranged for the taxi to pick us up at 20.30 to take us to the airport, so everything was ready. We were going to enjoy our last day on the beach and have an early dinner there before setting off.

About 10 o'clock, morning of the 1st, we got an email and a phone call from Air India informing us that the Goa to Mumbai flight was delayed by 1 hour and we would be departing at 23.30. They also advised that we might not make the Bangkok connecting flight. There is only 1 Air India flight a day to Bangkok.

We phoned Air India back, 45 minute call, trying to change our flight to an earlier departure from Goa. We got seats on flight AI 662, leaving Goa at 18.45, but we had to be at the Airport by 16.30 to claim the tickets, or we would loose them. This meant hanging around Dabolim airport for 2 hours. It was important that we made the connecting onward flight as we had booked a taxi and paid for a taxi to collect us and we had paid for the hotel.

The boarding went smoothly as the plane pushed back 10 minutes early and was in the air on time. But due to congestion at Mumbai we were slightly late landing there.

The seats were ok, suitable for a short haul flight and leg room reasonable, the cabin crew did not appear very interested.

We were served a snack, which was awful, it consisted of 2 slices of dry bread with a slice of sweaty cheese inside and a small bottle of water.

Once in Mumbai airport we had to hang around for 5 hours, not in our original plan, Air India did not offer us use of a longe or anything for the inconvenience and disruption, in fact they did not even apologise.

Overall opinion of Air India, not a lot. We also think that the original flight was cancelled as it never appeared on the flight information board in Mumbai."

The flying time was scheduled to take 4 hours and 25 minutes and we were due to land in Bangkok at 07.45, we landed a bit late.

Although the plane was a Dreamliner, so not very old, despite this the seats were really not very comfortable, not ideal on a 4 hours + flight, but had reasonable leg room. 

About half an hour into the flight, most people were trying to sleep, the cabin lights were whacked on full and the crew started to serve food. Saw what the person sitting beside was served and decided to give it a miss.

We were travelling from Goa to Mumbai with a connecting flight tko Bangkok. As result of Air India delaying the departure time of the flight to Mumbai and they could not guarantee that we would then catch the Bangkok flight (only 1 a day) we had to catch a mid afternoon Air India flight to Mumbai. This meant we had to hang around Mumbai airport, great as it is, for nearly 6 hours, not impressed Air India.

The lady at the airport said I will get a full refund on the flight, she filled in the request but when I personally went to the air India offices in Mumbai they refused saying that they send me a email on the 2nd the day I was flying out but I didn't have excess to my emails and they couldn't get hold of me on my telephone because I don't have a local no. Surely they could have made arrangements for my connecting flights.

WOW! Where do I start as to how the flight was:

Let me begin with the good part - It is a direct flight - very convenient; and it was mostly on time - both departure and arrival . But that is where the good part ends in my experience.

a) The cabin becomes a dust bin littered with stuff within first couple of hours. You can only imagine the toilet facilities - if they can be called facilities. The crew apperas oblivious to it - they do nothing about it where I have seen other airline crew making sure isles and even toilets are clean during the flight. Perhaps AI should fine people for littering inside the plane! They will make enough money to become profitable!

b) Flight attendant service was non existent. My isle was served by this one exceptional person - exceptionally RUDE on so many dimensions that is - Makrant Desai - condescending - like when I asked for help to bring down my bag from the overhead bin (way too high for me to reach) when I needed to take out a medicine he told me repeatedly I should keep it under my seat. I can only surmise, so I would not bother him again. This person exhibited total lack of understanding of his job that is rooted in “serving” his customers.

c) I was a bit sick on this flight so I didn’t eat any of the meals they served. You’d expect the crew to try to help make the passenger comfortable, just a bit - but they had nothing to offer! Also between meals during snack service, they put out a big trash bag in the food area which got filled quickly with discarded stuff, and parents were having tough time keeping their small children out of that. They really should not be doing that - its a a safety issue. Trash bin should be something children can't get into easily.

It is rather unfortunate the airline PM Modi so proudly stated would bring direct service to travelers between SFO and the Indian Capital is so devoid of “service”. Their crew does not really extend one morsel of care - and for the long flight that it, their food service seems like a “fast food service”. Crew dishes out instructions - get in your seats, open your tray tables .. so that they have to spend no time putting your tray on it and move on asap.

The fact that you can get non-stop from point A to point B has its merits but I for one value some degree of service and care if I am going to be on it for 15 long hours. So I only hope that I never have to get on this one again."

I filed a claim and was told it would take 24-48 hours to arrive. Since I was on a tour going to multiple cities, I gave AI reps my itinerary and the hotels I will be staying at. Also, the phone number of my tour guide. On Thursday morning, 2/23, while en route from Delhi to Jaipur we received a call that the bag is at Delhi airport. Friday night at 9:30pm while at dinner, a courier came and said he had my bag in his car. However, I would have to pay 1550 rupies (about $20) for the delivery. If I refused to pay he would return my bags to Jaipur airport. He did not accept credit cards and he did not have a receipt to show I paid. My anger is why did I have to pay for the delivery of my bag that was mishandled by Air India?"

Primary reasons are relatively comfortable seating, good delicious food and plenty of check in luggage. And yes, they are definitely the best priced so, this is it.

Being an avid fan, I was very surprised on my recent trip to Delhi from London and back. They have replaced Boeing 787 with a very old 777, so the entertainment screens leave much to be desired, the seat backs are cracked and the headphones they provide sometimes are broken (this was the first time). The flight was full and overbooked (perhaps both ways but certainly on the way back DEL-LHR).

For some reason, I am a firm believer in Air India and will continue to use them for rather parochial reasons, but I feel, with a little bit of effort , they can save money and make customers happy.

I must say that I have a bit of a bias for Air India . I have been subjected to Jet Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Virgin, Gulf, Emirates, SAs (when they used to fly to India),
I love SAS but they dont fly from Copenhagen to Delhi anymore, rather unfortunate.

The plane was the inevitable prop plane, used so often on these short routes. However, I was very pleasantly surprised with the interior of this plane. Unlike the fabric covered seats I have experienced on other Air India flights (which to me always look dirty and smell), this plane had lovely leather seats. And the interior was very clean - the carpet almost looked new. I declined the onboard snack as all that was on offer was a coleslaw sandwich, and it's not really something that is to me liking - what a shame Air India isn't able to match its rival Jet Airways' non-veg offering too.

Since purchase of these planes for long routes, their seats and entertainment systems are not maintained or serviced at all in the economy class. Seat cushions are compacted down and metal parts of the seats are exposed (please see attached pictures). I paid extra US$50 for each seat per flight (101 and 102, seat number 41 A and C). On both flights entertainment system did not work at all. Crew staff cannot fix hardware failure (I understand that it is not their job). Crew told us that they complained to ground staff to fix entertainment system but nothing happens. After Flight 102 on Jan 27, I personally went to an Air India Manager at the IGI airport to complain but instead of taking any action, he asked me to write it on Air India complaint box. When I asked for a refund of extra charge of $50 x 2 for two seats (41 A and C), he refused to talk to me. Plane was dirty. Bathrooms were not cleaned once during 15 hour flight (from Delhi to New York). Food was just OK; please do not expect what you used to get 7 – 8 years ago.

On the flight to London, it was a new plane and it was a comfortable trip (except for the fact that while checking in the Air India representative didn’t know where the Business class passengers were supposed to check-in from and sent me to the Economy class counter to board).
On the flight back from London to Delhi, there was a really old plane. My seat did not recline and when I was asked to change seats, the new seat has a cushion missing so one was sitting on the metal frame. I was then asked to return to my original seat and the crew got it to recline to approx. 110-120 degrees instead of 180 degrees. There were 2 washrooms in business class and in one, there was no water and in the other, the flush wasn’t working. I was left standing with soap on my hands and the crew had to wait for instructions from the pilot (!!!) to allow passengers to use the wash rooms in the front of the flight. The crew seemed to need instructions for everything from a senior staff member (there wasn’t any empowerment there)!! The crew was hard working but handicapped by the red-tapism it seemed. There was tape holding pieces of the plan together near the seats. Breakfast was a croissant and bun and fruit. I would be hesitant flying Air India in the future due to the possibility of an old plane being used for a flight."

The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours even though passengers were left seated on the plane. they got all the seat numbers mixed up so ended up being first come first serve basis. No explanation for delays just stuck on a plane where staff were hiding as they didnt have any explanation. Finally planes took off still no explanation and things only got worse when boarding a connecting flight from delhi to come back to London. Seats were a shamble, our pre booked seats were given to someone else as they had to ram the plane due to another flight being cancelled. Was horrible experience and would never recommend them or fly with them again."

Flight from Delhi was on-time, Thank God for that! but food was pathetic, they had only veg for breakfast, No Omelette!! Really!! so I was served thick half cooked parathas with some no taste pea veg. I only had a cold bun with the crappy coffee. On my way back from Mumbai, my flight was at 7 pm and I received an sms informing me about the flight being delayed by an hour. So I arrived at the airport as per my schedule thinking that I can spend the extra hour at the airport. At the airines counter the staff confirmed that there isnt any further delay.But when i reached the boarding gate, I saw the air inida staff lady sitting at her seat filling her nails, and the ETD was mentioned as 8:40pm which means a further 40 minutes delay which no one from the airlines bothered to inform. there was no sms too this time. and the boarding gates open at 8;40 which clearly means there is a further delay . and the flight actually departed at 9:15pm.
so a flight with a duration of 2 hours was delayed by 2 hours and 15 minutes. and reason: the aircraft came late!! really
are you not supposed to either arrange another plane or at-least inform about any further delay!!
such casual attitude for a 2 hr 15 minutes delay!!
seems like air India is used to it.. so it doesn't matter"

Our Air India flight was delayed, then delayed again, then cancelled completely. We were allocated onto another later flight - then it was delayed too. We were treated like a total irritation to the airline - just a nuisance - no customer respect or good service shown to us at all. When we eventually got to our hotel in Goa, many hours later than expected, the management there told us that Air India is always like that, and we should have selected a different airline.
I wrote an e-mail to Air India to complain when we got back home to Scotland. Then I sent another e-mail ... and another ... and another. I have now been waiting 4 months and I have sent a total of 23 e-mails, but they have not dealt with my complaint. They keep on acknowledging my communication in a standard message and apologising for the inconvenience, but they have done nothing to compensate me for a truly dreadful experience.
My advice to you - avoid Air India at all costs. Shockingly bad."

The flight and airline itself was fine - a bit chaotic (mainly the other passengers creating chaos)... at times it was even comical!

We seemed to be the only passengers able to locate our allocated seat without confusion, which was odd, as each ticket provides a seat number - understanding culture differences we though perhaps this is due to the numbers.

During the flight we were comfortable, had a selection of in house entertainment with some good films! The screens are dated and quite unresponsive and slow! If you accidentally stop a film halfway through good luck getting back to the same point!

Halfway through the flight a lady tried to climb over me, I was a bit confused, it turns out she wanted to get to the seat next to me - I couldn't work out why she didn't ask, or get my attention first, she then continued to lean on me and cough in my ear for the remaining 6 hours of the flight, and use my USB port etc.. (they provide USB!).. that's a plus!

The staff were ok, but didn't really see the need to see to the western girls (us) needs / requests, we usually had to ask about 3 or 4 times... there was no logical order to serving the customers, it seemed favourable.

The toilets could have been cleaner, however did provide mouthwash (random)...

The food was good - we both enjoyed Indian breakfast and lunch, it was tasty and filling. The snacks were Minimal, and water was sparing - we both felt pretty dehydrated!

All in all, we paid £298 for a direct flight from London to Delhi, we weren't expecting luxury, but I would suggest to expect 'random'!

Happy flying!"

However, at the transit desk the Air India staff told me it was 'not their problem' as it wasn't their fault, it was the bad weather. After being ignored, laughed at insulted at the transit desk I eventually booked myself a new flight at my own expense.

I have never experienced such rude, arrogant and incompetent staff as those at the Air Transit desk in Delhi, it was absolutely unbelievable. They are legally obliged to reimburse me for my flight, but there seems to be no regulatory body governing India flights that I can take the matter further with. Something I'm sure the staff their knew, explaining their obnoxious behaviour.

I was afraid it might be sketchy but I was wrong. First class all the way - good food, excellent service and even an airline employees assigned to glide me through visa control. Flight was a little over 15 hours and I was able to get a good night's sleep on a full and comfortable bed. Only two minor downsides: First- the video entertainment provided is dated but if you take a special two prong plug (which you will need for india anyway) then you can plug in your laptop and watch your own downloads. Second, there is no WiFi-so download programs before leaving home. Still, with weather delaying flights all over the East Coast, I would rather get to Dehli fast, comfortable and safe than have primo entertainment on a grounded jet."

We booked direct flights from JFK to Delhi which meant we had to deal with this airline for 15 hours straight both ways. Here's a summary of what we experienced:

* The seats are little more than stadium bleachers. Very little cushion and most seats did not recline. Imagine sitting in the most uncomfortable, claustrophobic seats for 15 hours straight.

* There was no electricity in our section of seats for full 15 hours both ways! This meant no entertainment system, no reading lights, no ability to call the air hostess, etc. This was true not just for our seats... but our entire sections. They were distributing newspapers on our way there... but without reading lights i don't know what they wanted us to do with it?

* The food was mediocre and just enough to allow us not to starve. nothing exceptional.

* The staff was polite at least on the way to Delhi... but it seemed like they had no idea how to help people. They didn't offer any compensation, any means to assuage the anger of really uncomfortable people.

The food was very bad..And the flight was 40 minutes late usual..But even after charging this much providing such bad food..But nothing can be done as there is no other airways from here.."

When I landed in Delhi I had asked for my stroller to be at the gate as I have a 10 month old. I had specifically requested this at check in and at the gate at Heathrow. When I arrived in Delhi by stroller wasn't there and I was marched from 1 staff member to another who kept telling me I get it in London at the baggage belt. I then had to carry two bags and a 10month old baby for the 3 hour stop over. I couldn't use the toilet or let her get down as the floor was filthy. I was hoping if I explained this to check in staff at Bangkok on my return journey they would ensure my stroller was available. But again it wasn't! Due to having to carry my daughter & bags for such a long period I have developed a cyst in my wrist from the build up of water from carrying heavy objects.

clunky interface, not user friendly, multiple loading errors and reminiscent of websites built in the early days of the internet. In fact, I had so much trouble on the website that I ended up using a third party website to book my tickets.

Understaffed, unorganized and inefficient airport staff:
The check-in process is ridiculously long. I have consistently had to arrive at the airport (in India) up to 4 HOURS in advance, just because of how slow Air India check in is. It is almost always understaffed and somehow each customer takes upwards of 10 mins just to check in. I remember once when the line was so long it stretched back to the airport entrance, and instead of more staff being recruited to help - staff were actually leaving their counters!

Unreliable in-flight entertainment system:
The selection is not bad and the screen size is good. If only it worked. In the majority of Air India flights I have taken, the the system is either malfunctioning, unnecessarily slow or simply not working. Once when I realized the nobody's screens were working, I asked the air hostess to reset the plane's entertainment system (a common practice in most airlines when the system doesn't work), and she had no idea what I was talking about and how to go about doing it; I and the rest of the passengers spent the entirety of a 7 hour flight without in-flight entertainment.

You know it's a sad situation when a country's budget airlines (IndiGo, Spice Jet) are leagues better than it's flag carrier and largest international airlines (Air India, Jet Airways)."

Good:
Service personnel on board are average. They definitely need better training

Bad & Ugly:
My wife and I took this flight out of compulsion due to a bereavement in the family.
To start we could not select seats together on the AI website or APP. Both were extremely complicated and absolutely not user friendly.
On getting to the airport we were told the flight was full but when we got on board six seats had been blocked for the crew (Do they not have bunks?) Finally we were able to sit together.
Interior of the aircraft looked as if it had never been cleaned and parts of the seat were broken, the buttons to adjust the seat were not legible and were extremely grimy.
The seating arrangement was 2 - 3 - 2 very strange.
Meal service was a joke, no printed menus choice of food pathetic, service and presentation a joke. See photographs.
Choice of wine was white or red - laughable, they were serving the cheapest wine on the market.
We could barely eat the food provided as it looked stale and unappetizing.
After the meal service we asked for a bottle of water and it took three requests before we received it.
Seats - advertised as full flat beds but not nearly flat they seats has a very weird incline and not cushion, you could feel the metal frame through the padding. Very uncomfortable
On waking up around three hours before landing we were served tea in the tiniest cups.
We kept waiting for breakfast service but no one came around, around 45 minuted before landing we were told since we were sleeping they did not wake us, but we were served tea a few hours ago?
On landing at Delhi we tried to use the AI lounge at the domestic airport, I explained to the person at the desk that we had flown DEL-NY and had to fly back right away NY-DEL and would like to use the lounge, but to no vail.

All I can say is even if I was offered a free ride on AI I would not take it, the government of India should be embarrassed to offer a product that is so horrible.

The pollution & smoke from fireworks during the festival gives many people respiratory problems. Many people on the Air India flight were coughing which was to be expected, - but two women behind (our friend was sitting next to them) were coughing & then spitting onto the floor. Surely this is not acceptable.

On arrival, our luggage was damaged mine a soft cover was bent/twisted but not torn. My daughter's expensive Samsonite hard cases were ruined.. Both cases had multiple cracks right through the shell & handle, they cannot be used any longer. My daughter reported the broken cases immediately, forms filled & photos taken and the all important ref number & contact phone number for her to call.
She tried the contact number many times during our stay in Sri Lanka & got the run around. She was told to meet an Air India employee at Colombo airport before departure. This caused problems as we needed to check in & the Air India representative had to be called many times, he eventually turned up with two other men. They really didn't care when they looked at the damage cases and were certainly not going to take responsibility for the damage. Then an offer of $75 for the damage. A very uncomfortable discussion went on - No, their boss Lady could not come she was in her city office (we had 2 hours till the plane departed) - They withdrew their $75 offer & told us to go to the Air India office in our home city of Perth. Where is the office? we asked - They came back & said there was no Perth office - we should go to the Sydney or Melbourne office. - ""Do you know how faraway we live from Sydney?""
Clearly these employees were not the people that we should have had to deal with. They appeared to have no managerial or customer service skills. My personal feeling is because we were women, these AI employees had no intension of doing anything & were stalling. Knowing that no further face to face discussion could take place after we left the country, and the report would never be followed up. Since returning home my daughter has phoned the Air India office in Colombo - you guessed it no result.
Air India will not suffer because of my review - as they have so many people traveling between Delhi & Colombo.
Surely someone at Air India must be responsible for customer care & service."

My Finace was having none of it so we ended up putting on 7 layers of clothing each so our bags went from 5.9 kg to under the limit. Then, while wearing all this excess clothing they told us our (now almost empty) carry-on bags had to go in the cargo hold because there was no space in the overhead bins - even though when we got on the plane there was plenty of space. This prevented us from easily storing these extra clothes. We have photos to prove this. It felt like they they were trying to punish us for not paying them extra $$$ at the gate and putting on the clothes instead of handing them cash - especially since another customer right by us wanted them to check his handbag and they wouldn't take his, instead they made us hand over our bag or they said they would prevent us from taking the flight. We made it OK and didn't give them any money but I think that was only because we made a fuss. They even THREATENED us repeatedly to not let us on the plane and they did end up losing one of the bags we had checked. Then once on they flight they delayed takeoff for 1 hour to get 36 bags that for some reason hadn't gotten on the plane, then we left without the bags anyway after 1 hour. MY United States FRIENDS DO NOT FLY AirIndia! It is a suicide mission! This was my first and last trip with Air India. If management is looking for someone to blame, this was all the fault of the Dubai Air India ground crew for the flight from Dubai to Mumbai leaving at 11:40 pm. We asked for the names of the ground crew but they refused to give us their names and also told us for security reasons we could not take photos of the employees doing this - I assume this is how they assume they will be able to get away with this behavior without getting in trouble. As a company please find those people and make sure this doesn't happen again or you will lose all your customers to this terrible treatment.

So they diverted the flight to Jaipur. Once we reached Jaipur, they kept us waiting 3 hours inside the aircraft with no food or refreshments just kept on saying that they will fly soon. After 3 hours, all passengers asked to allow us to atleast go to the lounge area on the airport. there were kids as small as 3 months old travelling but they dint bother to take any action. Finally they allowed us to go to the airport. There was no Air India Official there to give us any kind of information regarding the delay. They announced that the spare parts are going to be called from delhi and then they will do the test run and then they will fly. They had no clue how long this would take. We waited 7 hours at Jaipur airport and only after yelling and shouting at the Air India Official who arrived later we were arranged for another aircraft to fly to chandigarh after 7 hours of waiting.

While flying back to Mumbai, after landing at the airport we waited for 2 hours on the baggage belt. The flights arriving after us got their baggage on the same belt. Air India had no clue whether are baggages where.

Yes, the 2-3-2 seating configuration in business class isn't as modern as the pods but it is just fine. Seats are wide and there is plenty of room to stretch out and move about. The front cabin is three rows and this is preferable to the rear cabin in business class which is 2 rows, the middle section reserved for flight crew. Flight left on time, and lunch was served. We chose the western meal of salmon which was pretty good. Service was friendly and competent and attentive. After lunch, lights go down and people read or watch entertainment until sleep time. Entertainment is not as broad ranging as Air Canada for example but there was enough to watch, some new, some classics to amuse oneself. Breakfast is served 2 hours before arrival and that too was just fine. Seats fold down to almost flat but contour of the cushions does not make for a smooth surface. Folded down, seat is about 65 inches long meaning feet stick over the end and there is no foot extension. Not different from my experience on ANA long haul. Not a full bed but sleep is still manageable. Overall, not an unpleasant experience as many have suggested for 14 hours in the air."

The bathrooms got so dirty the smells leaked into the cabins. When I went into the back to stretch for a minute or two the cabin crew was just sitting and chatting while eating their own food. I asked for an extra blanket which never came. They very rarely (if ever) attended to call lights that people had pressed. There were several elderly people in my row who I ended up helping myself. One needed more water and couldn't even find an attendant. Another felt dizzy and was having trouble sitting up. Again, not an attendant in sight.

Economy",I will never ever fly with air India again.,"To begin with, we tried to check in online before our flight, my boyfriend managed to check himself in, after numerous phone calls to air India because every number was wrong, I was no where to be seen on any of the check in papers, rang air India again, and he said that I was all checked in, and sat next to each-other on the plane. He lied to us over the phone. When checking in at the airport it seemed like no one had any idea of that they were doing, which made the process so much longer. Boarding was delayed, but with no communication so just left everyone waiting around for ages. Once on the plane, the plane was very out dated and run down, the inflight entertainment system did not work on my boyfriends side, only on mine. Then I went to use the bathroom half way through the flight, and there was urine and faeces all over the toilet and the floor. Was absolutely disgusting. Staff at the airport were a shambles but the air hostesses we not too bad, food was alright. I will definitely never be using this airline ever again. Ruined the start of my holiday."

Economy","Miserable facilities, equipment, legroom, service","My wife and I flew from New Delhi to NYC yesterday on Air India--and, as in our outbound flight several weeks ago, were most disappointed. The reasons: (1) Equipment: On both the outbound and return flights the lights and/or tv screen didn't function properly. (On the return, it was both lights and tv.) Oddly: someone sitting three ahead of us had a controller that controlled our overhead lights--although the tv didn't work any way at all. If this equipment doesn't work, what about the plane's flight controls??? (2) Seating: despite our having selected seats and had the assurance on our etickets that we would be assigned these seats, we were assigned different--and less attractive--seats when checking in. And we checked in quite early--among the first passengers to do so. (3) Food: in brief: awful: The smaller meals were dreadful: doughy rolls with no cheese, an omelette hard as a rock, etc. Worse yet was the main meal: a chicken curry loaded with chilis but in which no masalas were evident. This gives Indian cuisine, which we adore, a terrible name! (4) It is incredibly difficult getting frequent flyer credit for flying with AI. We had an account that expired and couldn't renew it. And enrolling again is terribly hard: one needs to send a photo and much other information. We have frequently flyer accounts with numerous airlines and no come close to making it so hard to enroll in their program. AVOID THIS AIRLINE IF POSSIBLE!"

Decent flight and less tiring than an overnight flight. I travel in this sector quite often and the most convenient flights are Cathay & Air India. Jet has changed its evening flight on return to a Noon flight which means the full day is wasted.Having flown Air India earlier several time on this sector i was pleasantly surprised by the vastly improved service standard in the Economy Section.
Attentive hostesses is ofcourse a 1st check.Delivering service with a smile is one of the most important factors to make a passenger comfortable on a 6 hour flight.On this particular day Wednesday 18th on AI 317 the Hostess who was in the cabin section named Aarti was going about her services in an ever smiling manner and deftly serving two drinks with one hand and not getting irksome if asking for another drink. Placing another pack of peanuts snack just as the 1st one was about to finish are all small gestures s that show that Air India is on the road to to getting better, This is a busy sector and invariablly planes are 100% full capacity and obviously its a strain to meet all passenger demands.Its good that AI has dedicated staff like Aarti as it only helps to build on a sagging image on service. The Business Class service is Ok but still needs more improvement as I flew last month on the same sector, Happy to see the change,will fly more often now on AI even in Domestic sector"

Our 9.30pm departure was delayed by 2 hours and they rushed the food trolley around, no drinks offered at all on this long haul flight aside from water which came with the meals. I was really looking forward to a glass or two of wine to help me sleep on this night flight, sadly it wasn't to be! DVD equipment was very poor both on outward and return journeys. Foot rests didn't stay up either on any of my flights so it was uncomfortable having to rest my feet on these on all flights. Cabin crew barely even check that passengers are wearing seat belts either, how slack! Food tray was dirty from previous flight and there were used tissues in the leaflet rack in front of me from the previous flight too, shocking stuff!

Cabin crew were obviously in a hurry to get to sleep. Very young crying baby in front of me for 6 straight hours, not fun for the parents BUT definitely not fun for me or other nearby passengers either. Not one single member of staff came over to see if they could offer any assistance. Horrid experience at Delhi airport with other Air India flights from other places late as well and everyone who had an on-going flight was panicking going through the ridiculously slow and inefficient immigration and body search ALL over again (why they need to go through that all over again when you're in transit, who knows?!). No one from Air India even bothered with any advice or assistance to 100s of passengers freaking out thinking they were going to miss their onward flight. I just kept my calm as I knew my flight wouldn't be taking off without me and the dozens of other stuck in the queues.

Return journey back to London was not much better, although it was on time. Cabin crew really are haughty, no matter how polite you are. Will avoid in future. Jew Airways and Virgin offer much better service according to others I know who travel to India regularly."

I don't even want to recall my experience with this airlines. Attitude of the employee is the biggest fall. Delayed for 12 hours in DXB airport and finally offloaded as I missed my connecting flight. Ground staff doesn't even know what will be the arrangement once I miss my connecting flight. While I got offloaded, I requested for offload clearance document in dxb Airport, the staff said ""it's not required"", so I proceed to go out of the airport and Immigration asked for offload clearance document from Airlines. I tried contacting Air India ground staff, no one was available. Finally Immigration officer helped me to contact one of the manager of air india and the same guy who said ""it not required"" came running after 3 hours, just to give offload clearance document. Just because of one staff ignorance, I had to stuck in immigration for 3 hours after 12 hours tiring night at boarding gate.

Then I took flight the next day via different route. The attitude of inflight staff is ""THE SAME"". Turned on ""call for assistance"" button. Light was on for more than 20 minutes, nobody even bother to approach. I do not understand how this airlines got member of Star Alliance.

Leg room was sufficient, but the entertainment system is a bit outdated and needs to be a bit more varied. The food was nice, a choice of vegetable, Indian meat dish and continental meat dish. They all looked nice and the two that I had were lovely. The service was also very courteous and friendly.
One annoying thing was, the flight attendants didn't clear up the rubbish during the flight so when we disembarked, we were trampling over rubbish to get out.
All in all, it was a decent flight but I wouldn't rush back to Air India. Maybe I'd try first class to see what that experience brings."

So much overhead luggage was in the plane it was hard to store even a small bag,and the foot room minimal. The seat was uncomfortable and the spins could be felt. To make this trip even more delightful was that 9 out of 12 seats either had broken T.V.s., headphones that didn't work or tray tables broken. On the flight home ,one rear lavatory was out. It was a poor choice. We will never fly air India again. If we do return we will stick to Emirates or Ethiad. Even if there are no direct flights. I heard Air India is getting new planes in 3years.

My wife had the misfortune to succumb to a stomach bug during the latter part of our trip and was feeling unwell as we started our return flight from Amritsar. By the time we reached Delhi, for an en-route top, she was clearly becoming seriously ill and after landing I requested the attendance of a doctor on the aircraft. The doctor asked that she be removed for the flight and my wide received excellent attention in the airport medical centre. Unfortunately her recovery caused us to miss re-embarkation of the aircraft by a few minutes.

The ground staff at Delhi obtained permission for our (non-transferable) tickets to be re-validated for the following day at no charge and then arranged for us to stay overnight at the on-site hotel, again at no charge to us. I can imagine no other airline being equally caring and generous, based on my fairly wide experience, and I can do no other than recommend Air India very, very highly.

This being such a short flight a snack was served. No choice was given so everyone had a coleslaw sandwich with a mango fruit juice and a water. I can't say I'm enamoured by coleslaw sandwiches, even with adding the supplied ketchup. Needless to say I gave it a miss and just took the water.

They would not entertain the notion that they should reroute us through Delhi or elsewhere. Every question we had was answered with ""it's no problem."" Well, clearly it was.

After being shuffled about for two hours, they put us on a bus back to Varanasi and put us in a shady hotel, one that had no idea we were arriving. A terrible experience that cut our time in Nepal by a full day.

Once we were flying, it was clear that the plane and its staff were not as good as the discount carriers like Kingfisher and Jet, which we had already flown.

The plane even looked like it needed to be washed on the outside!"

First of all.... to check in for domestic flights had to stand on line for almost 2.5 hrs. as there was no separate line for domestic and internation. Then once we got up to the counter.. they said our luggage was over.... we were travelling internationally from Saudi to India.... We checked with airlines three time prior to travelling.. and they said you are allowed international luggage... we were so tired to argue at this point.. so went to cash counter to pay.. the employee there was soooooo rude.... they didnt accept USA dollars or credit card. Had to go all the way to the other side of the airport to exchange the money and then they give us clearance to the flight I HATE Air india.. and this was the last time we travelled with them.. NEVER again......

I'm a frequent flyer (this was my 11th and 12th flight since September) and I was disgusted at the poor service. To start with, when queuing up to board my flight in London there was a distressed gentleman who was asking for help but the staff shouted loudly and shooed him away in a humiliating and dismissive manner. Then halfway through the flight I was asleep and got woken up by cabin crew telling me I had to put my seat upright because they were bringing meals round (I've never had this before, they should've let me sleep). Then an elderly gentleman thought he heard a child crying in the toilet so alerted cabin crew. A staff member then opened the toilet lock without knocking first and discovered a male passenger inside who was annoyed he'd been barged in on so the flight attendant then stood there shouting at the elderly gentleman saying it's his fault she opened the door because he misinformed her! Both gentlemen looked embarrassed as she caused a scene. When I got up to ask for a drink cabin crew rolled their eyes at me as though it was a huge inconvenience even though they hadn't offered drinks for several hours. The aircraft was dirty and the carpet threadbare. The whole experience was absolutely awful and considering I've flown approximately 70 times with various airlines I would NEVER fly with Air India again. The entire crew from ground staff to cabin crew need to learn some manners and respect and certainly need to be trained in customer service."

The Aircrafts are old , the seats worn and tatty. The entertainment system does not work well. On one leg of the flight, I knew several members of our group whose entertainment systems did not work. When the crew member was notified,his only response was to agree that it is not working. He did not offer to help in any way.

The Crew: the worst customer service I have ever experienced on a flight. I couldn't understand this because India prides itself on amazing hospitality. Indeed, I have experienced this first hand whenever I stay at Indian hotels. I have used other Airlines serviced by Indian staff like Jet Airways and Etihad, and the experience on those occasions were great. All I can say is that from my experience of Air India staff, they were a disgrace! One of our group asked for a soft drink and it took them 1.5 hours before they brought it. Dinner trays were left for at least 40 minutes before they were cleared, not because they were busy but because they couldn't be bothered. Having waited a long time to have her tray cleared and in spite of calling for assisitance several times when nobody arrived, my daughter finally took her tray back to the service area. She was surprised to see that the crew were not busy serving but were doing crosswords!!

The Food: I am not a great fan of flight food but on one occasion they served a croissant with cheese that looked like it had been put together by a 3 year old.

Overall, one of those experiences I would never ever want to repeat even if they are the last airline left in the world!! India can definitely do a lot better than this"

The food was second to none and it was wonderful to have Indian inspired meals on both inbound and outbound flights. A word of advice, you are flying with an Indian airline and personally think it's unfair of people to post negative reviews about being provided Indian food on the flight, so if you don't want a curry for your lunch then take a sandwich on board instead.
I thought the in flight entertainment was good with various films and TV programmes to watch. But I always take my tablet with my own stuff on just in case.

I could see my next passenger asking for more food & drinks which were right-away provided. At Hyderabad, most of the passengers alighted with only a handful left for Bangalore! Because of this, the Airlines operated Hyderabad-Bangalore Sector for domestic passengers. Cabin inspections followed by boarding of passengers with lot of hand baggage really took quite some time. Since Muscat-Bangalore passengers were already tired and a few half-awaken children here & there were uncomfortable, I felt it's a bit nuisance at those early hours of 2.30am!

It was clean and most importantly, the seats had more leg room than some of the more illustrious airlines flying Mumbai - Singapore route, including Singapore airlines. AI's Dreamliner had the best economy class seats I have seen in recent times. Secondly, the flight departed bang on time. (May be I was fortunate!).

Now coming to service, Air India has a long way to go before being compared with the good airlines in the world. A long long way to go, I would say. Here's why -

1. Check in at Mumbai airport took a good 1 hour. They had just 1 check in row to cover all international flights departing from Mumbai (including a couple of counters for business class). Non separate counters for baggage drop for those who have pre selected their seats. On inquiry with the staff, I understand that it is very normal to have such long queues at their check in counters. This is definitely not acceptable!

2. The cabin crew obviously does not believe in 'service with smile' policy. A passenger seated besides me passed his coat to a cabin crew member to store in the rack during the flight. He was sternly told by the cabin crew member that he should 'remind' them (to return the coat) after the plane lands. The good airlines in the industry do not expect to be 'reminded' to do their duty! .... and when the passenger did remind the cabin crew members a few minutes before landing, he was told ""why don't you collect it after the plane lands"".... The cabin crew member has no business to pose a counter question to a passenger. If he has difficulty in returning the coat at that time, he should just say that he is unable to return the coat now because of ___.

3. On all other overnight flights from Mumbai to Singapore, I have seen cabin crew move around with trays containing water/fruit juice. Lot of passengers do like to have a glass of water or juice after a couple of hours of sleep just prior to landing. Air India seems to have a 'water on demand' policy. If you want water, you have to call the cabin crew member. The lucky ones are served, or else, the cabin crew members conveniently ignore the requests.

AI's cabin crew service had always been their weak point. I travelled AI after a long gap and found that (sadly), their service still needs miles of improvement."

It was not possible to board the connecting flight by opting for the rescheduled flight. Hence, I reserved 4 seats over telecall with the call center of Air India. I got the oral confirmation from the Air India authorities that 4 seats have been reserved against my PNR.Moreover, I got the seat No.s too. However, at the check in counters of the AI, I was informed that, the reservations have not been made against my PNR and there are no seats in the early morning flight. Hence, I need to travel solely from the rescheduled flight which was leading to miss my connecting flight to Chandigarh. On large arguments with at the check in counter, I was given 4 reserved seats, which were not at all comfortable (the seats were near to emergency exits).

It i, however, to be mentioned that, the staff at check in counter was too much courteous to help us out in the entire process.

After making the complaints to the AI website, the same is till date, to be replied."

The flight was delayed for which we got a message. At the airport, the Air India staff was unaware of where the check in counter for our flight was. After standing in a queue or 40 mins, we were told that the counter had shifted. When we moved to the other counter within another 30 mins of waiting, the server of Air India went down and we had to wait in the queue for another 30-40mins. By this time, there was no update on the flight status. Later we got hand written boarding passes. On reaching the Mumbai airport we got to know that for around 32 people the luggage was not loaded from Delhi. The Air India staff did not have any update on the luggage and they had no clue as to when should we expect the luggage. They had 3 flights scheduled in the next 6-7 hours from Delhi but our luggage was not even loaded in those flights.

Two more times I have faced an issue with Air India wherein they announced the wrong belt number for our baggage. It caused a great deal of inconvenience to all the passengers.

Also,I would like to mention that the Air India staff at the airport is too clueless when it comes to a situation that is different than usual. They are not capable of handling customer problems and are very slow and ignorant when it comes to providing any information to passengers."

The in-flight experience in AI from Surat to Delhi on AI 490 and it was fine - this being an evening flight it was an Airbus 320 - a large aircraft that could accommodate my luggage. The same in the flight from Delhi to JFK, NY i.e. AI 101 was also good - it was a sort of ""overnight"" journey - board at around 1:00 am and land at 07:00 am local times.

The following could be useful to those aiming for similar travel:
1. When I checked in at Surat India, my two suitcases were thorough checked-in upto JFK, NY. The luggage check-in upto Denver was not possible, even though had a single PNR. I must acknowledge that the airline officials at Surat were very cooperative and they tried all their means to see that the luggage is thorough checked-in - however that was not possible.
2. However, at JFK, NY, after I finished immigration and customs immediately outside there was a counter of Delta through which I could checkin my luggage again. So even though my outbound flight from JFK, NY to Denver was from a different terminal, I did not have to actually carry the luggage with me, Simply drop the luggage at the Delta counter and then proceed to the terminal to collect the boarding pass. This was a great relief, though thorough check-in of the luggage upto Denver would have been great.
3. One of the strange aspect for the flight 101 originating from Delhi is that, one has to do security check TWICE - first the routine security check at the airport and then one more AT THE GATE. This is the first time ever, I experienced such dual security checks. So one muse be prepared for the unnecessary hassles !!

My annual vacation this year centred around a trip to East India to tend the renowned Hornbill Festival, but I will not be getting there....two of my three flights cancelled extending my journey time by 36 hours and to cap it all, one of my bags containing many essential items has also been lost! But this is not the main issue! I travel extensively on business and know that problems occur. My problem with Air India is the off-hand manner in which my issues have been ""managed"" and in some instances, the absolute LIES that have been told to me about my travel by Air India staff. Candidly this is unacceptable and something that I have never experienced with other carriers around the world....shame on you and the culture of your company. I have incurred considerable expense and my holiday has been ruined. I will vote with my wallet and next time will book with alternate carriers....until you educate your staff in effective customer service.

Thus, our domestic flight from TRV-AHMD was jeopardized. We learn about this on December 1 and call Air India Customer Service immediately. Supervisor on site, Manor, had assured that either a refund will be provided or Air India will handle the responsibility to finding different route so we can reach Ahmedabad. We go to Male Airport on December 2, we had to explain this all over again and supervisor on site, Ganesh, had asked us to fly to Bangalore and take the flight to Ahmadabad from there by visiting Indigo's counter. We reached Bangalore and learn that Indigo is fully booked. We go back to Air India's counter and went through, not 1, but 5 different people and in the end they come back and say, ""Please make your own arrangements"". This is a perfect example of corrupt and unethical India that we all speak about and we witnessed it. We had to buy a ticket from different Airline to reach Ahmedabad. It was Air India's responsibility to handle this in a professional manner, but they elected to ignore this and prove that they are part of the corrupt India program. Truly shame on them for this. I had called Customer Service and they assured that it will be investigated and it has been a day since.

Air India's has no competition in this sector flying non stop to Delhi, but with a single stop this is the competition: Lufthansa (A380), British Airways (B777), Air France (A380), Cathay Pacific (B777), Singapore Airlines (B777), Etihad (B777) and Emirates (A380)."

Air India is often under estimated and regarded to be a substandard airline. Nothing is far from the truth. The Business class aboard the B787 dream liner is as comfortable as one can expect. YEs. It does not really offer the privacy of the Singapore Airlines. The seats are arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration and was really comfortable and are lie flat seats.I could get a solid 8 hours sleep on board.The movie collection was modern and updated and in my opinion, better than that of Singapore Airline's entertainment system.

The air crew were super courteous and helpful throughout the 13 hour flight. They offer PJs in the business class passengers. The food is served hot on fine china plates and is really tasty. I would highly recommend the passengers to travel on this airline.
Only improvement the airline needs to make is to manage it's checkin staff. That is whar brings the image of the airline down."

I glued my eyes on it till i got out of the toilet, the last thing I want is to get sick... we decided to leave the lounge and have a look at the rest of the airport shops, nothing special... i checked the toilet near gate 3 & 4 but is was flooded... not an option... boarding was on time, but was held the at the bottom of the stairs, as the cleaners weren't done yet... when boarded the aircraft I found my seat occupied, had me thinking that at the check-in counter they switched the poor woman seat so they can accommodate us, but she was nice enough to move to a different seat... seat are way too dirty, discolored and old... arm rest in the middle is filled with dust and food particles... the window has 2 insects, colored white, i can't even identify... the carpet is old, dusty and worn out... the curtain dividing the cabin from the crew's work area were probably a decade without washing... there's a dark hand print at the monitor or screen... i did not dare use the planes toilet upon seeing it... this plane should be overhauled... there are a lot of low cost airline but still manage to maintain the cleanliness... this is beyond dirty... the aviation authority should have a serious look in these planes..."

Then the check-in guy asked us if we wanted to sit together (of course) and so issued new cards with seats together - not sure why he didn't do that in the first place.

As soon as we got onboard the plane there was a horrible smell, which got worse the further we walked along the aisle. The smell lingered the whole flight.

Seat was not particularly comfortable and the fabric seat covers, rather than leather, looked and felt grubby.

The snack issued was just a veg sandwich, which did not look appealing so I stuck to the water.

Flight thankfully arrived on time and we were glad to get off and away from the smell. Overall not a great experience."

Then, when we got into the aircraft, the aircon was not working and it was boiling hot. After insisting by the passengers, the passengers were deplaned.
Then we were told that we would be given accomodation in some hotel. At the last moment, we were informed that flight was ready to take off in another 2 hours. It was 3:00 pm at that time. So we had a choice that we could fly on the same day or we could wait for the next day. We were told that the technical issue has been fixed.
However, we were boarded the next time only after 4 hours at around 7:00 pm and in the plane, aircon was still not working. For the whole duration, we had to use the safety instructions card to fan our faces.
When we got down at Delhi, we were told that we had to take our baggages and check them in again for the next flight and we were taken to Hotel Taurus. The condition of the hotel was terrible.
Then when we finally reached Amritsar at 6:00 am in the morning, we did not get our baggage. It could have been understandable if they had to transfer the baggage to the new flight. But this happened even after we collected the baggage on our own and checked it in again at the next counter.
Then we were handed over a Property Irregularity Report at the airport. The person said that the baggages would reach our address on the same day and gave us two contact numbers. Its been two days now, no baggage delivery yet, no communication from their side and even after calling on these numbers, no one is picking the phone up. I must have tried the numbers atleast 20 times.
I think its highly unprofessional of Air India. The staff and management are bringing huge shame to the nation."

From DEL (where we transited) to BKK the Dreamliner was in operation. It's a very comfortable aircraft and service was excellent. Only thing I noted there didn't seem to be any effort to promote onboard duty free sales. Perhaps there was none.
Check-in at BKK was also smooth. There was some irritation evident in the lady checking us in when we requested notation of our FFP nos but she did do it. Dreamliner again. Service excellent. No duty free evident again.
Earlier I've had multiple bad experiences with Air India reassigning the seats on second legs of connecting journeys. This time we had the seats we had reserved. One major grouse removed! In the last few years I've flown Etihad and Quatar. Cabin service on Air India is definitely better, at least in Economy. The vegetarian meals are at par. I'm thing of switching over exclusively to Air India, route and fares permitting."

First, there were several changes for the time schedule between reservation and departure. Then, there is no agreement between Thalys and Air India, and finally, there are several hours between Thalys' arrival and possibility for checking, and inversely. Once in the plane, the screen did not work, the tablet was partially broken, etc But hostesses were nice. When I came back from Kathmandu with AI214, because of changing plane schedule, there was no time for the next flight AI143: once arrived, the gate was already closed. Because we were several,int he same condition, we got it but it was really not easy for me to run from one gate to the other. But, luggages arrived until Paris in spite of the short time between both flights. Air India was quite better several years ago."

The passengers on this airline expect that they can push and shove to get on and then sit in whatever seat they like to be with friends and families. The passengers then expect you to find another seat. The flight attendants are not overly helpful with this and spend a lot of time trying to negotiate with people instead of just directing people to their assigned seat. Food was only ok with bread and croissants stale. I am unlikely to choose this airline again! There were also many screaming children on my flights and it seemed they screamed the entire journey without respite. Too many younger kids without seats!"

Waited in the long queue where only 3 counters were open. When I reached the counter, I was told that my seats do not exist and would need to be changed as they have now changed the air craft. Funny part was my colleague who had a similar seat was already given the boarding pass. when I informed them, he was given a new boarding pass.

As I had a connecting international flight, I was wrongly sent thru domestic departure rather than taking the international transfer because of which I faced further problems. Avoid Air India as the staff is not professional.

Also the fares are quite high as compared to other domestic airlines. Air India should learn from other countries govt. airlines how they manage and how they handle the customers. Too much improvement is necessary and also the city like Pune should be connected with all major cities of India.

On arrival at Delhi they told everyone that the suitcases have been left behind and that they will be delivered to our destinations within 2 days. 1 week later and still no suitcases, the help desk in India & UK have no idea and are very keen to pass the buck to another department.

Why did they invest millions in new Boeing Dreamliners when they can't run a local bus company, when will they instal someone at the helm who gives a damn about the traveler, why do they have this corrupted mentality that no one can accept any responsibility ???????

Sadly i can see this flight dying from Birmingham (UK) as the stories we hear on a regular basis won't let it survive. Air India needs to wake up and listen, this can be one of the most lucrative routes from the UK to India.

Let me run your UK operations, I promise I can turn it around in 2-3 years to a real money maker... in fact let my 11 year old run the operation, he'll do a far better job in turning this circus comedy into a business that travellers can trust & enjoy for many years to come.

The staff attitude was one of not caring about the passengers at all. Seemed like they were just whiling away their time in order to complete the shift. On pressing by a few passengers, they put up a board saying ""DELAY DUE TO TECHNICAL REASONS"". Seems like their standard reply. Luckily the flight was only delayed and not cancelled otherwise it would have been a nightmare with the ground staff attitude.

After boarding, the meal served was prompt but was very average. The airline crew was also not bothered to greet the passengers at all and had a poor attitude about their jobs.

27th Sept 2016 21:30 flight. Arrived at airport to be told Flight cancelled...... Check in desk gave a £7.50 food voucher with offer for a Hotel or pay taxi fare home.
Took Taxi home. Check in Staff informed us after taking passenger details that they would contact passengers with details of next days flight.
NO CALLS FROM UK AIR HANDLER.
I made many calls to Air India to check on flight details, Takeoff time given varied from midday next day to 13:30 , Checked in next day 2 hours before 13:00 flight . Eventually took off at 16.30.
NO INFORMATION ON DEPARTURE BOARD, LIMITED INFORMATION AFTER CHECKIN.
ANYBODY ELSE STILL WAITING FOR COMPENSATION, WILL WE GET ANY?
Generally an OK airline but next time ( Nov 2016) I'm going with EMIRATES...

The times are very convenient and since it is a continuation flight the leg between HK and Seoul at least on my flight was not more then 50% full. I don't think most people know about it. The plane is a 787 and is quite comfortable. I skipped food service as the outbound flight is early and ate at the United Lounge in HK and the return flight is mid afternoon so no need to eat.

Will definitely do it again!"

I complained to the flight attendent abt the quality and asked him to give me a feedback form which he conveniently forgot and when I went to the rear of the cabin I found the staff busy on their mobiles, sitting with legs stretched on the door; ala office babu class. The flight announcements were almost inaudible, unsure and the english language was ripped apart. We certainly need to project a better picture of the national airline. After a chaotic checkin experience at the bagdogra airport followed by the on board service by the air India staff, I am convinced that the national carrier is the pits."

I took AI 307 from Narita, Japan to Delhi on the 22nd October. The Japanese staffs who were handling the check-in counter were very courteous and eager to help the passengers. In a crowded air line check-in counter there are always passengers who lose their patience. The check-in counter of AI 307 was not different. The staff, however, was very polite and attended to all passengers with their inherent politeness. Air India apparently does not have its own lounge in Narita and AI passengers are handled by Air China. The lounge overlooking the runway is well furnished. It had a fairly good stock of food and beverages.
The best part was the service on board and the flight in itself. The crew on board Ms Achla, Ms Shagufta and Ms Saito were extremely courteous and equally efficient at the same time maintaining true professionalism. Every need of the passengers were anticipated and met very promptly. The starters, the main course of lunch and the snacks in the afternoon were all delicious and presented matching to or even surpassing the dishes of any premium restaurant. The flight, a Boeing 787, very aptly called the dream liner, was very smooth, gliding above the clouds, all through the little over eight hours it took to reach Delhi from Narita. Since the air pressure in the air craft was maintained at 6000 feet compared to 8000 feet in other aircrafts there was more oxygen and higher moisture in the cabin, making one feel very fresh even after such a long haul flight. I could get a good two hour sleep in flight on the seat which reclined to a flat bed.
Anyone with this experience will never be contented with anything less. The AI hospitality indeed had a touch class. Felt really proud to be an Indian. I am very happy to recommend this flight to all discerning travelers."

the service was awesome and the food was great(being Indian helped i guess) the flight crew was serving the passengers with all they could and very accommodating and helpful.

The flight takes nearly 13 hours but it was not as tiring since the legroom is good.

Surprisingly, I have never heard any of them trying to push a non-veg meal to a vegetarian. This routine makes me sick and tired.Three of us decided to refuse the meal and stay hungry.

Since meal preference can be given at the time of booking the flight, it can be printed on the boarding pass and meals loaded in the flight and distributed accordingly. I understand the crew have no option but the Air India management should be more professional if they want to compete with other airlines."

This journey was the compensation I received as Air India misplaced by luggage the first time I traveled with them, which I did not get it back for 4 days.
This trip was booked over 6 months prior to us travelling and the seats reserved.
We booked in at Birmingham airport at 19:30 for our flight at 21:00 which went without a hitch. The check in agent booked us through on all three legs of our trip which was via New Delhi and Mumbai. The first leg of our journey took us to New Delhi arriving at 10:30 local time the next day which was fine, just as it should be. We transferred through IGI in Delhi without a hitch and caught our flight to Mumbai. We went to check in for our last leg to Goa I was held me back while the rest of our party and everyone else boarded as there was a problem with my booking (remember I had been checked through in Birmingham the previous evening). The surly check in clerk made a phone call and came back with my ticket with my seat reservation crossed out and a new seat handwritten on it. The flight was late boarding so this hold up made it even later. When I got on the plane I found someone else sitting in my seat. I told the cabin attendant there was someone sat in my seat, but she wasn't interested either and said I would have to sit somewhere else separate from the rest of the group. I asked how could my seat be reallocated after it had been booked 6 months prior and confirmed the previous evening at the start of our trip, guess what ""not interested"" This alteration that Air India caused now meant that the flight missed it's slot and was late taking off. When we arrived at Goa airport we went to collect our luggage and I noticed the Air India ground staff waiting to deal with passengers complaints with their missing luggage forms in hand. Not once did I think that my luggage would go missing a second time, how wrong could I be. All the other luggage for our group arrived, except mine. The staff at Goa airport could not have been anymore unhelpful if they tried. Nobody was the least bit interested as this happens all the time, and did not seem bothered that I was without any of my belongings. I spoke to 3 different people and each was as uninterested as the last, even the station manager. I was offered IR1500 as a payment for the inconvenience which I was told to collect on the way back through the airport on my return journey. I eventually got this up to IR2000 as when this happened to me 2 years previously this is what I received. If I hadn't argued I guess that someone would have kept this for themselves.
If you are considering using Air India I would seriously look at using different airline as Air India's service is very poor, and there are far better airlines out there to choose from."

The seat was broken and could not be completely moved forward and the plane seems dirty and old. The bathrooms smelled all the time (not to mention at the end of the trip). The airline needs to consider cleaning the bathrooms better and throughout the flight. They need to upgrade and clean their planes. I also flew to Mumbai and Jaipur from Delhi in separate flights and the rules for bags, weight, what you are allowed changed all the time, and the agents blamed the previous agent for the misinformation. This is an easy fix for the company: just make sure that you either enforce or not all the rules. If the rule is 8 kg on board, then make sure that its applied everywhere not just in Jaipur and Chicago. I was not thrilled with my experience."

The color scheme of Air India isn't as crisp inside and planes are generally dirtier on the outside, the crew are pleasant but not which the chirpiness of some other airlines, like Indigo or Vistara. Even Spice Air does a better job of making you feel special, or like you are going somewhere with people who really care. That may seem a bit harsh but there isn't the sharp edge that Vistara and certainly Indigo have."

Economy",Gate change not communicated,"We chose to fly domestically with Air India while holidaying in the country. The return flights we chose turned out to be a connecting leg of an international flight - one to Newark and the other to Shanghai. As such they were jam packed. One flight had a gate change at the last minute. Locals with the inflight app must have got a notification but those of us from foreign countries sat waiting at the gate printed on our just issued boarding pass. It looked too deserted and if it wasn't for our proactive enquiry we'd be waiting until the last minute. To make matters worse the gate change was from one end of the terminal to the other, so a good 20 minute rushed walk with children. The gate change announcement finally came as we were boarding! The boarding was extremely disorganized with people cutting in and pushing as if catching a local train or bus. Many passengers even disregarded the staff request to allow the disabled and families with young children to board first. Finally on board and my son's seat has dried tomato sauce type runs by the window and tray table. Clearly the cleaning staff were too busy that day (imagine putting up with this for your entire international journey!). On one flight my seatbelt only came up half way up my waist, so had to swap with my skinny daughter. Another seat was broken and should not have been allocated for an international flight. But the staff were friendly and helpful, so made up for it on our 2 hour journey."

Within few minutes of this conversation, I received a booking confirmation. At this point, I felt happy that I got a seat and I was all set to return to Bangalore.

When I entered the queue for Check-in it was long and felt tiring as there were only two check-in counters open, in less than 3 mins two more counters were opened felt very relieving as the queue started moving quick, I knew my baggage was over 24Kilos and the limit was 15Kilos mentioned on my itinerary, I was surprised that they accepted the baggage without additional baggage fee (I had to pay additional baggage fee while I was travelling from BLR > DEL during that trip).

Services offered On-Board was just like any other Airline
- Economy seat (good enough for a 175mins flight duration)
- Meal
- In-Seat entertainment
- Courteous cabin crew"

We decided to fly Air India because the timings were more convenient to us than any other airline. The flight was a little delayed because of the incoming flight, but the pilot made up for the lost time. The plane was clean and the seats which we had selected were surprisingly blessed with good leg space. The snacks served were good as well. Air India is known for its service and the staff on the airline did not let the airline down. The travel experience was great- the landing was wonderfully executed! Overall a wonderful flight experience."

The details provided telephonically by Air India representatives are misleading at times saying luggage needs to be collected directly in Mumbai, which in not the case

One has to collect the luggage at Delhi and that being your first port of entry, you have to go through immigration and security check. The Delhi airport staff is not upto the mark as yet. Its quite a big airport and you have literally run from your international terminal to your domestic one. With a child it becomes really very cumbersome. Some of our friends forgot to check-in the liquor at Delhi Domestic terminal which they had earlier collected at Birmingham airport. Please ensure to check in the liquor bottles.

Also the security check in at Delhi takes ages. The tray to put your electronic items is very small. It was very frustrating to go through the hassle of changing from international to domestic terminal especially after a long flight journey when you are extremely tired."

International
Economy",Looked after me better than the British Embassy,"I duely booked my flights online to come back to the UK after almost 2 years away and ended up flying with Air India. My First Flight from BKK was on a new Dreamliner plane which was great, food excellent, staff very pleasant and entertainment options great - all was just perfect on the first stretch of my travel home. There was a transfer as part of my travel, so I had to change at New Dehli for a connecting flight to London - This is where the nightmare started - once getting off one plane you were then guided to yet another security area where your luggage and person were again checked by security, the International Transfers lounge was absolutely heaving and in front of me I could just see what looked like a never-ending mass of thousands of people, at this point I was a little worried that I would not get my connecting flight which was just over one hour away.

After at least 30/40 minutes of queuing up - I could finally see the security check area. It was amass with people all trying to get through what seemed like a very very lackadaisical approach to security, the Airport staff were joking about and being very very slow in their approach to security, it was disorganised and massively understaffed - everyone was very agitated - to be honest, the security area was diabolical and people started to jostle each other about at flight times were getting very close to the knuckle. I finally get to put my bag through the x-ray machine and have a body search, it was at this 'even more chaotic' part of the security area that I had my passport stolen - yes stolen in security!!! This meant I would miss my flight. The 'big boss' came to see me and i can only assume his team were watching CCTV to identify the person that took my passport - I was beside myself.
After 4 hours or so, i was paraded BACK to the International Transfers lounge - where i had been 5 hours ago and left - with the explanation that 'we will be with you in a moment sir'. Imagine - my phone only worked in Thailand, there are no food concessions, no shops, no ATMs, no internet - a lounge with just a frantic Air India team all working behind a large desk - I was in 'no man's land' and after another hour or so I was met by an Air India Official who explained that the forms that had been given to me by the head of the airport security dept to travel would not be sufficient as I am unable to fly without a passport, he was very kind and gave me some time to just explain my situation - which i would continue to do at least 15 more times to different officials. He beckoned me over to speak to the British Embassy in India, who were absolutely terrible, no help, no visit, no food - NOTHING, so I'm stuck, by now it was evening and i had been there since about 10am - I was offered food by Air India. to be honest, it wasn't anything to do with Air India, it was due to the erratic complete disorganization of the airport security department, that if proper due diligence was being employed, no one would have had an option of stealing my passport OFF THE SECURITY GUARDS DESK. I actually felt like causing an affray to just get arrested and then at least getting noticed, i sat there , in one chair for almost one day, with no phone/food/internet/money/contact with family (waiting for me at Heathrow, well, they were. I was then met by the head of Air India at the airport who asked me to relax and Air India would do everything in their power to get me home, starting with a trip to the High Commission in the morning and I was shown to a bed longer (where unfortunately building work was being conducted on the floor above, so no sleep there).
In the morning at about 7am I was greeted by a young, well turned out uniform - he had briefly spoken to me the day before and introduced himself (sorry I cannot remember your name) and he looked at me, held his hand out and said that my passport was in the possession of Air India - he went on to explain that the person was identified who took my passport and he was arrested at Birmingham International Airport where my passport was seized - given to the captain/cabin crew of the return flight and it was en route! four hours or so later I was reunited back with my passport (I can't tell you how that felt) I was then pulled to the front of a HUGE queue where I was asked which location I would like to fly back to in the UK - any destination and It would be taken care of by Air India - remember, this entire exercise was looked after by Air India, not security, not the airport, not the British Embassy - an airline - and to Air India, for their compassion and care - I am forever grateful. I arrived back in Heathrow where I literally wanted to kiss the tarmac!"

Air India wants to change my flight from Kathmandu to the previous day so this would mean I have an overnight 20 hour stopover in Delhi. This is bad enough but they're not even willing to pay for a hotel to stay in overnight. I find this hard to believe and am really hacked off, Air India, never again."
