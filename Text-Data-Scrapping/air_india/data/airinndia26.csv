I had a chance to travel in Air India flight from Chennai to Hyderabad from in January'16. The trip was a day trip. Both take off and landing were smooth. The pilot was really a capable person. We didn't know when we started and when we landed because the flight reached before the destination time. The flight attendants were really good and did good service. The Airlines provided lunch as soon as the take off began since while returning we came in another company flight and they did not provide anything to eat (Actually, we paid the same amount for both the trips). Had a nice experience travelling in Air India."

I Picked air india as it was the only airline flying to my destination without a massive layover and was also much cheaper than all the others, and so I figured a £2-300 saving was worth 30 hours of possible mild discomfort and boredom.

Air india is a 2 star airline, I read all the reviews before I booked and expected the worst! The main problems they seem to have is the little tv screens not working. Also Online check in is a complete failure, I actually rang them up to pick my seats and the phone service in the uk was pretty good. not sure if the people at the airport actually knew though, but they booked me onto exit window seats for the first two flights so I cant complain ;)
getting onto the plane and low and behold the tv doesn't work!, I however had come prepared and had spent £40 of the £300 I'd saved on a new laptop battery and some films to keep me entertained :D
Other than that the flight was fairly comfortable and the food was good, although if you don't like indian food, you may struggle here.
Also we didn't crash and die, so I'd use Air india again if the price was still the cheapest :)

So apparently Air India has no responsibility for baggage. Also follow up service and other snags on our return trip soured our whole experience with Air India. Several Indian friends and European ones who travel to India had warned me about Air India and advised me to look elsewhere, sadly we ignored this counsel. My strong advice to anyone considering flying with Air India is don't, there are many alternatives .... USE THEM !!!"

We thought the cabin crew could do a much better job in serving the passengers.It was a short flight and so wasn't tiring at all. When we landed in Kolkata we had to take a bus to the terminal which wasn't convenient. A concourse or ramp would have been much more convenient.

1. I believe that the Flight time is shortest if anyone travelling from East Coast to India and vice versa.
2. No hassle of connecting flight, it is a direct flight.
3. The food is authentic Indian (you can also enjoy the food if you are not Indian)
4. In last trip to India in 2015, we stuck up in traffic and reached the NY airport late, AI staffs helped to get our luggage checked in and complete the security check just in time.
5. In that way couple of last minute checked in luggage could not reach to Delhi with us, however I got my luggage back within couple of days without any problem.

Now the thing to improve is that airline can boost their reward program flexible and cut down the ticket price bit more. Also the in flight entertainment options like movies, music etc. can be better."

North India faces acute cold during winter and extreme heat in summers. During winter months, smog is a common problem that plagues almost all air and train services in the north India. That requires airports and airlines to be CAT III compliant. Air India is the only local India airline to be CAT III compliant. That means, no matter what the weather condition is, Air India is able to fly there.

Second is connectivity. No airline covers all 100 odd airports in India the way Air India does. So it is a matter of your choice which connections would you prefer.

My experience has been remarkable. Thick into the fog days, I had to travel from Bangalore in South India to Delhi in North and there was no choice but Air India. The flight was on time and the food was excellent. The air hostesses are a bit ill-mannered, as they do not treat customers well because they think they are doing a service to the customers, as customers do not have a choice.

In all, it is punctual, planes are comfortable and the food is good. If not for the crew behaviour, I could have given it a 5 star."

First things first, dedicated counters , well manned by staff who were working right. Pleasantly surprised to see a Baggage Allowance of 25 kgs on my ticket. Most all Airlines ( low cost / full service offer only - 15 kgs). Had passed through Security by 11am for a 11:45 flight. Thought of grabbing a quick bite before boarding the flight, surprise again , the flight was already boarding. AT the gate seeked a possibility of a Seat change with a vacant adjacent seat. Promptly done, but was informed that it was the last row. Still took it , despite having a thought in my mind that there would hardly be any leg room.. the aircraft was clean as well. Despite the last row, non reclining seat, with a height of 6.2 i had ample legroom to stretch myself completely. Again a Bonus when compared to other airlines in the market. The crew was normal, minding their work, and assisting us in between. The Departure time was 11:45 and believe me we were air borne by 11:45. Since it was short flight we were served with Veg Light snacks that contained a cake & Cheese Sandwich, which tasted good. The cruise was fine without any major turbulence. We landed into Chennai by 12:20 hrs and was out of the Airport by 12:35 hrs. ( The Actual Time of Arrival was 12:45 hrs). All in All a Decent Fight Experience. Additional brownie points for the Leg Room and 25 kgs of Free Baggage Allowance."

The Best thing about air india in this regard is that they allow passengers to prebook their seats without any extra charge. we had booked a three seats in a row on the left side of the cabin. The check in was comfortable. I checked in the counter as i had few check in baggage and my parents were first time flyers.
The check in and the security at Delhi airport was smooth, so was the boarding.
The seats were comfortable. There was no significant delay.
The Non Veg food was reasonably good. However the quality and the taste of the veg food which included upma and vadai was not upto the mark. My mother was with her inflight headphone on, on her window seat when the flight attendant asked what she should be served. as my mom had could not understand him I repeated the question and passed on the reply ""non veg"" to the flight attendant. Despite this the attendant kept on asking the same question repeatedly. When told again, the flight attendant was visibly upset that he was unable to hear the words in my moms own voice- so much so for service to the senior citizens!

I was taken to another location in the airport where it was discovered that there was no issue with my bag. I then returned to join my party to travel but we weren't allowed by Air India to go to our designated gate (no explanation was given) and within ten minutes our plane departed. We were left at this other location for half an hour longer with no clue as to why we couldn't board the plane and were then taken to go through security again and leave the departure lounge as we were no longer due to take a flight. Stranded in Delhi is not a nice feeling! We were told to go to the Air India desk to sort it out which we did and were told, very unsympathetically that this was out of their hands and that we would have to buy another ticket. They took 5 hours to return our bags by which point we had missed all flights for that day to Sri Lanka. They refused to help us and made it very clear that 'these things happen' and that the only way to get to the second leg of our dream holiday would be to spend £200 to buy another ticket with their airline the following day. We also had to pay for a hotel for the night and at no point did anybody attempt to sympathise or help. The attitudes of the Air India staff at the desk and the departure gate were so beyond comprehension and I urge anybody to fly with anybody BUT them. Disgusting on every level. I was travelling with a friend and her elderly parents and this was a traumatic situation for us all.

Business Class",Has improved greatly,"We flew AI roundtrip; first in economy and return in business. Service, comfort and amenities were very good in both. In business class the attendants were surprisingly aloof though professional. The layover and international transit in DEL are annoying, with uncaring/disrespectful airport staff. I would avoid transits through DEL."

Giving extra baggage upto 25 kegs is the highlight. This enables me to buy sweets for all my relatives. More leg space. Very courteous air hostess on board and tasty food. I enjoyed every moment of the travel.

Worst part is there was no information, even after we entered the airport (I had started all the way from Nuwara Eliay which is about 200 kms away from Colombo) and nobody there to answer. With great difficulty, we could contact the station incharge and that lady had nothing but a standard response of ""I cant help - this is due to delay in incoming flight"".

Being an Indian, I felt ashamed how its national carrier treats its passengers in a foreign country (my experience was somewhat similar in Singapore few years back, although not this bad). My son kept on asking how the hell this airline became a member of STAR alliance, which I too still keep wondering!!

Avoid this airline whenever possible.."

Our direct flight from Kathmandu to Varanasi was cancelled about 2 weeks before flight, and we were rerouted via Delhi. The flight was delayed by a few hours and as a result we missed our connection to Varanasi. We spoke to the ground staff in Kathmandu and they said it would be sorted out when we landed which didnt happen. Air India has an arrangement with Jet Air and despite asking in Kathmandu we didnt get moved across to the later Jet Airways flight which had seats and which we would have been in time to catch. We were accommodated in a very shabby hotel in Delhi with mediocre food. The next day the flight was again delayed by a few hours - in all our 3 days in Varanasi landed up being just over one day! Our next flight was from Delhi to Kochi - luckily we drove to the airport faster than we thought we would so were 30 minutes early. Flight had been cancelled and we had been put on one an hour earlier with no notification to ourselves or our travel agent. Local travel agents all recommend the other airlines over Air India - by far the worst experience we had in 6 weeks of travelling through the country. Never again!"

Nevertheless, this time I took Air India for my trip to Bangalore in January. The reason being it suited not only in terms of time but also surprisingly to the pocket.
I was really happy with their hospitality and the service and also the yummy breakfast that was served.
The airline staff were polite and helpful and were smiling as well. If you have a flight early morning, even if its 9:00AM, you have to reach the airport well in advance. Coz all the Air India flights depart from T2 (the new terminal in Mumbai) and its humongous. There are no announcements happening and hence you need to read the sign boards carefully or ask.
You are all hassled and In such a case if you get the airport and airline staff who are polite and smiling, it make your day :)

Thank you Air India for making my journey to Bangalore a happy one. Would love to fly Air India again."

Though the in-flight customer service was nice, i found them a tad less professional than that of other airline carriers.

The few things which i appreciated, was a non-turbulence smooth flight, and the food provided by them, which was nice and warm.

Last but not the least, you can get a way better deal, in terms of both cost and flight experience, in other airline carriers than in Air India."

Was served a welcome drink and was welcomed by the crew with a smile at the entrance. Crew were friendly. Captain gave regular updates and ended his note with JaiHind! This needs special mention as in my previous AI flights sometimes the Captain never interacts throughout the journey.Good Indian vegetarian food served. Wide variety of drinks served too. Very comfortable Dreamliner experience with flat beds. Entertainment had relatively good collection of movies and songs for the 4 hour journey though maybe inadequate for a long haul flight. Arrived 30 min ahead of schedule and received baggage as priority. Be prepared to walk atleast half a km inside the terminal for immigration formalities as Dreamliner gets parked at the new terminal of Chennai airport."

When i arrived at the check in the counter staff was extremely courteous as they greeted me with the traditional 'Namaste' and a warm smile! Being a First Class traveler i would certainly look for attention to smallest detail. The checkin took less than 5 minutes and i was escorted to the security by one of the staff.
The Lounge access was given given after all the formalities and i enjoyed a cup of tea in that comfy lounge couch.
Shortly it was time for me to board & i was again escorted by the same staff towards the gate.
Going on board it was a very clean cabin and the crew was very welcoming!
Nice seat i must say & of course a cool entertainment screen!
I will have to give a special mention to the food! it was brought out on a meal cart & had a great choice of veg & non veg delicacies! full marks here as well!
The flight was on time! and the VIP treatment given to me was definitely a winner! I shall surely look forward to my next AI flight!"

Twelve hours staring at the back of a chair was be not boring beyond belief and the lousy food did not help. I have attempted to contact Air India several times since my return and have not had the courtesy of a reply. It appears Air India does not care about their service and sadly reflects back on the country that they should be promoting. Never again!!!
