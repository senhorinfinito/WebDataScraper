Check in staff opened up late and exhibited the worst customer service I have experienced. At one point, yawning in my face. Slapping our documents down then moving back from the desk for a break & a chat after ""serving"" 2 customers. Then it went down-hill. If this experience was bad, it was worse at Delhi on the return flight and on checking into another Air India flight in Deli to Kathamadu. APPALLING service. The staff looked like they were being forced to work under pain of suffering. Disinterested, bored, non-responsive...... miserable. How sad that India's national airline has such a toxic employment culture.
The flight. The Dreamliner is a lovely plane. The food was good. It was very quickly served but, once service was over, that was the last you saw of any crew. They set up a bench in the galley where they could sit behind the curtains and avoid attending to any customers needs. I have never seen that kind of behaviour from an air crew before. A friend traveling with us is still fuming when he related a rude encounter with a flight attendant. We had a wonderful holiday in India and Nepal, marred only by the worst imaginable 4 Air India flights. Air India obviously has big staff cultural problems. I really didn't expect that to start at the check in in Sydney. Yes, Air India has nice Dreamliner planes and does fly direct between Sydney and Delhi but, if you want a pleasant experience, DO NOT FLY WITH AIR INDIA!"

Air India like Thai and Alitalia, come from countries that logically have the DNA to create amazing airlines as they have second to non, the culture, food, fashion/design and inbuilt hospitality to create best airlines in the world. To my continued disappointment, this does not seem to happen. In our recent trip to New Delhi on Air India (and we haven't been on AI for many years) while we were happy that it was a Dreamliner, the upkeep on the interiors was poor, seating design can be improved similar to cathay which would be good for business for AI too as it would add more seats (fish scale seats), amenities and food was average and presentation of it was equivalent to better airlines economy class. The savior was the service although they really need to hire one of many many talented Indian designers to design new uniforms! Fit flops dont seem to be suitable as part of the uniform too.

We needn’t have been. The only problem we came across was the insistence of Air India to show proof of our ESTA’s before we could check in. We’ve never had to do this before and it caused a large crowd of people trying to find proof on their phones. It did cause a fair amount of panic amongst several of us. No where in all the booking details advised that this would be necessary.
The flight was good and comfortable. The main meal was lovely - if you like curry. The other smaller meals weren’t that nice but edible (ish). No communication at all from the flight deck and the cabin crew were a bit surly.
Boarding and disembarking was from the forward door only which is a pain if you’re sat in the back.

Unfortunately, a passenger developed a medical condition and the flight had to be taken back to the boarding bay for a doctor to examine the passenger. One cannot fault the airline for this, bu the least they could have done was kept other passengers well informed of the timelines in this incremental delay. They even served just a snail sandwich and a tetra pack juice. so passengers were left with this much to eat right from 2000 hrs - the reporting time, till we landed at 0115 hrs!"

The Dec 2nd flight I took had excellent in-flight attendants who were very professional, responsive and pleasant right through the flight.

One of them immediately attended to one of my requests even as he ushered in people who were still boarding.
Apart from this, the attendants were generally very prompt and patient with the service (Air India attendants, especially on the international flights, in general do not have a good reputation for customer service).

It was great to see that the AI 507 staff on Dec 2nd presented a very professional image of the airline.

Economy",Good Flight . Bad service,"Firstly the good parts :
Great timing of the flight. It starts at 11.30 pm India time and lands you in Singapore at 8.00 am. For leisure travelers, this is an superb time, as it allows you to sort of finish your day to day business activities and then embark on the flight. Also landing in Singapore in morning time, allows you the use of the complete day - either to rest or to start your vacation at the soonest.

The aircraft for this flight was the Boeing 787. An excellent airplane - with all the modern amenities that go along with an airplane of the 21st century. More importantly the airline allows for higher cabin pressure (almost 80% of sea level pressure) - reducing dryness and overall fatigue. Also the noise is appreciably lower than other aircrafts. So basically we arrived in Singapore in great shape - relaxed and not that tired.

The Bad:
The bad started at the airport itself. We stay a little away from the airport and from experience in Mumbai i know the area gets pretty full with traffic. Plus we were to leave 1 day before the Ganesh festival (the biggest festival of Mumbai) and a long weeked , and hence we anticipated extra traffic. So we reached the airport like at 6.00 pm - beating the traffic. Thankfully so, since despite leaving at 5.00 pm, we still did encounter traffic. However the counters did not open before 8.00 pm and we were left twiddling thumbs at the departure gate. An early checkin would have helped us spend more time at the shopping areas , possibly at duty free, and spend some more time at the lounge.

There was no dinner served on the airline. It was just snacks. Also no alcohol. I felt we could have been served with both, since this was a late night flight and most of the people would arrive without having a full dinner. At the flight the airhostesses basically just served food and ran away into their cubby holes to sleep. There was no ""service"" where they are around to ensure the comfort of the passengers."

I was traveling with my husband and 20 month old son and the staff went out of their way to make us comfortable by rearranging customers so that my son could have his own seat without us even asking. More so, they came around and ensured he was well strapped in and comfortable for the landing. The plane itself was a Dreamliner and very comfy with more leg space and a greater recline than I have experienced with any U.S. carrier recently. The bathrooms were modern too. Both the flights to and from Hong Kong left on time too. The only negative point I will say was that the flight left Delhi at 11pm and flew 5hours landing with the time change at about 6am in Hong Kong; therefore, it was essentially a red eye flight. I understand why airlines provide a full meal on this length of a flight especially when keeping up with standards and customer expectations but the cabin had its full lights on for all but one hour of the flight and their was a lot of noise and activity thus making it impossible to sleep. I personally would have preferred a small snack and beverage and then the time to rest so that I felt rested upon landing.

Overall though, I have heard numerous horror stories regarding Air India but have to say my first experience was a positive one and I would consider flying with them again."

The condition of the aircraft depends much on its age - a new one is nice enough but the older ones have broken ports, dubious screens, half-broken remotes, dodgy seats and general shabbiness. Toilets are the same as in most other airlines - clean enough depending on how the passengers use them and leave them. You cannot expect the crew to clean up after everyone. No complaints about food - it is as expected in coach and, being Indian, the taste (though bland) doesn't offend.

I prefer Air India from US destinations because of the direct flights. I've made several trips and was delayed only once but that was an issue with the airport. The airline called (both automated and human) to update several times. The on-board crew are polite but usually fail to appear when buzzed. This has happened to me multiple times and even buzzing at 15 minute intervals produced no one. I'm not sure if they are understaffed or lazy. I've found it easier to just walk up and ask for beverages/snacks. On the plus side, your alcohol comes in a small bottle and not poured in a plastic glass with an eye dropper. If you are fortunate enough to be flying in one of their Dreamliners then leg space is more than you can expect in better airlines along with a nice interior and entertainment system. Bottom line - it's not the cheapest airline around and if flying direct was not my main consideration, I wouldn't fly Air India."

I usually travel to Barcelona (Emirates) or the US (Lufthansa/BA), so this trip was a relatively shorter one. When I searched for flights online, I was looking for a non-stop. Unfortunately, the only one that offered a non-stop was Air India, the Indian government carrier. Before booking, I read several reviews online - from great to mostly mediocre service. In the end, I decided I would rather do 4 hours on Air India than 12 hours on a more convenient airline which needs to make a stop. As I arrived at the Check-in counter in Chennai, I found the counters had not opened, there were no separate lines for check in vs bag drop and when the staff eventually arrived, they seemed to battle with the system to print every boarding pass. To my amazement, that was the only lot on the entire trip. Their Dreamliner equipment that they fly to Singapore is amazing, great leg room, great seats, quality food and very experienced Cabin crew. Their entertainment system and the choices available pleasantly surprised me. On the return trip, the check-in process was a little less painful but the rest of the experience was excellent. On my way out, I told the Air India guys 2 things:
1. Improve your check-in process (tools, people, process) massively.
2. Do your in-flight announcements in destination/origin language (Tamil in this case) rather than just Hindi and English.

To my fellow travelers who want to go to Singapore from Chennai or vice-versa, take my word - go Air India and you will not regret it. They are the cheapest too by far."

They kept putting us on flights that left 15 mins before our connecting flight in Delhi. We called, and they fixed it, then the next day they would cancel and move it to an impossible flight. Finally they wanted us to fly the day before. We accepted only on the condition that they pay for room, transport, and food. When we get there, we had to wait 2 hours to get the vouchers. Even tho we called weeks before and set this up, they were not prepared. All the other people on the flight were trying to make arrangements, and we were the last ones to be served because they had to go find ours. It was a total mess!

The staff were more interested in their phones during flight than their jobs. The girl beside me with a baby didn't have her seatbelt on. The guy in front of me had his chair back during landing, and my partner had his tray down til I made him put it up during the landing. They left water in the overhead bin for you to get yourself, and the food was horrendous and made me sick. One steward had his tie loosened like he just walked in from a hard day at work, and the stewardess was buttoning up her clothes in the back....not sure what was going on, but taking care of people wasn't their priority.

On the flight back, they once again cancelled our flight and made impossible arrangements, so we had to call and get it fixed.

Never again will I fly using this company! Staff are horrible, the call center doesn't have a clue and refuses to help, the organization is clueless and disorganized, the food and service a tragedy!"

The ground staff was not able to assign proper seats and was totally confused. The system showed some seat numbers and when the boarding passes got printed, it showed some other seat numbers. They even missed prints of some boarding passes. It took us about 45 minutes just to check-in for both flights.
We had a transfer in del between flights and it was a harrowing experience. My grandfather and grandmother were on wheelchairs and the wheelchairs did not come to pick them up from the flight. The ground staff told us to keep waiting in the aircraft. Since our next flight was soon after we decided not to wait and instead got hold of 2 wheelchairs and started pushing them. Finally when we reached to board the next aircraft, an old man at the boarding gate had the audacity to speak really rudely to the female members of our family. When asked to speak politely, he threatened that he would de-board us.
Such is the status of the staff of Air India. No wonder, it is in huge debt and government is trying to sell it off. NEVER FLY AIR INDIA!"

I travelled on its 777's which have only nine seats across, compared to the ten on a newer version of the same 777. This gives you an idea of how more space you get!

If you go in other flights like Etihad airways, their air hostesses behave very well with their passengers. If you ask them to take your stuff out of the closet, they will take it out happily for you. They know how to keep their passengers happy whereas Air India their service is very bad.

We had to book random seats online, then phone them to book the extra leg room seats. It doesn't seem quite right that you can't just book and pay for them using the online facility.

The way they treat passengers wr really nice and even flights are more comfortable to travel. They use small flights for short distance travel, 100% neat and very clean flight looked traveled in Brand new flight.

People who believe Air India service wont be good enough, kindly change your mind and try once. When problem arises, all the flight service used to be same - Govt or Private - both will be same service.

one big advantage which i really noticed comparing to Indigo flight is SAME amount for multiple or 2nd transaction. In Indigo if you complete flight reservation, then if you want to add any of your family members again, price on same dates increased to 50% from previous transaction. But in Air India, they kept same rate for 4 different transactions on same time.

However, after dealing with their call center and customer service, I will NEVER fly with them again, and recommend you do not either.

Long story short. Flying to a wedding in New Delhi this November. Had to cancel everything because of the Natural disaster that is occurring their currently and everyone is ignoring.

If you haven't read about it, the air pollution problem that comes about this time of year, is at its all time worst, 5-10 times worse than that of Beijing. They wouldn't even let the kids walk outside to school for 4 days, but they are OK with it now that it is down to 5 times the severe level?

However, trusty Air India will still fly you to your death! Literally, people are getting blood clots, heart attacks, major lung problems from the burning garbage hanging over the city.

Anyway, my gripe is with the call center and the awful service they will provide you. No one wants to deal with your problem, they pass it on to the next, complete inconsistency in every person you talk to. They put you on hold for 15-20 minutes at a time when you want a supervisor. The Supervisors all give different answers and lead you on to believe you actually have a chance at some sort of refund.

Just classless care for their customers. I was just trying to get a rebooking fee waived so I can take the flight at another time (which they would do) for an additional $500? Cancellation of the flight entirely is going to cost me 1 of 2 ticket costs - about $1000, which is just absurd.

Don't waste your time with Air India, if you must - get travel insurance, and I pray you never have to call and speak to someone at their company."

Business Class","MOST surprisingly, EXCEPTIONAL!!","As I am almost exclusively a One World flyer, this was my first opportunity to fly Air India long haul and experience their service in Business Class. I must admit, I was somewhat ambivalent initially as I am typically used to First and Club World service in the air.

To begin with, check-in was at Heathrow Terminal 2 - The Queen's Terminal. After being greeted with a warm smile, I was impressed to see the check-in process carried out quickly and effortlessly. As Air India does not have a dedicated lounge at Heathrow, its premium passengers use the United lounge, which was aesthetically pleasing and spotless, whilst offering impeccable service.

On boarding the aircraft, I was again impressed to be welcomed with a very warm smile. The Business cabin was very clean and, with only three rows of seats, felt very spacious as well as intimate. Being a Dreamliner, the aircraft feels light and spacious and the cabin is very silent even at 37,000 feet.

There are so many aspects that I could comment on that were done wonderfully, but I will focus my review on the following:

- Once we were boarded, the Captain came onto the PA system and welcomed everybody aboard, wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day. I thought that was a wonderful personal touch and I was already looking forward to seeing what the service provided by the cabin crew would be like.

- The seat was big and very comfortable in the upright position. When laid out as flat bed, it is slightly angled - something I am not used to with my usual One World carrier. Having said that, I was offered pyjamas and an amenity kit and there was no shortage of pillows or blankets to make my journey extremely comfortable. The only downside, if any, was that the amenity kit was extremely basic compared to the offerings of other national carriers.

- It goes without saying, what I was really looking forward to was the food - and I was not disappointed. To say that the food was exceptional, appropriate for the flight segment and of restaurant quality would be no exaggeration.

- The one aspect of my AI 130 experience that stood out by a mile above all others was the service. As mentioned above, I have grown accustomed to First and Club World service over the years and I believe that both products are (almost always!) very good. The service provided by the AI crew was warm, gracious and attentive without being intrusive. The perfect combination, in my opinion. My preferred beverage choice when flying is (i) champagne; and (ii) sparkling water (with ice and lemon). The crew ensured that my champagne flute was topped up without my ever needing to request it. The meal service was done with efficiency and, again, with that warm and welcoming smile that I was now beginning to associate with my AI experience.

I must say that I found the entire flight experience so impeccable that I requested to see the Flight Services Manager and gave my opinion on the exceptional quality of the service, also requesting for a comments form for me to complete.

The crew in the Business cabin all made an effort to come and see me at some point through the duration of the flight, as also prior to commencement of landing to Mumbai airport.

I would not be exaggerating in saying that the service I experienced on this flight was effortlessly on par with - or even, in some instances, better than - First Class in-flight service I have experienced in the past.

The only issue is that it now raises a dilemma of sorts in my mind - do I still continue my patronage to the One World program, or do I now select Air India whenever possible for my long haul travel? All things considered, this is definitely a preferred position to be in!

My Namaskar and warmest congratulations to Air India and its wonderful crew for making this flight one of the best that I have ever taken!!"

Surprisingly Air India was the least expensive flight at such short notice even though it was direct. I had really low expectations reading all the earlier reviews. It turned out to be pretty good in the end. In no particular order, here is what I thought. Their website sucks. This doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Please make booking easier. Copy emirates if you don't know what to do. The check in process at the airport was straightforward. I had to remind the lady at the counter to attach the priority tags on my baggage. May be she would have done it anyway but a different reviewer had pointed it out so I was careful. They did put the tags on my luggage on the way back without my saying anything. So maybe I was just too paranoid after reading all these reviews. The first class lounge for star alliance was good but way over crowded. Had to hang out for 10 minutes before finding a seat to share a table. On the way back, the AI lounge is less crowded but well below the standard that it needs to be considering it is their home base. But there are plenty of staff and they will jump at any chance to serve you. Compare that to zero staff at star alliance. My screen, power supply, headsets were working fine on both flights. However, a friend of mine who had traveled a week earlier in economy did not have a working screen both ways. It is stupidity not to fix this because AI seems to get the most grief on this account from passengers. Do you really need pissed off passengers on a 15 hour flight? They will take it out on the crew who understandably cannot do anything about it other than keep rebooting the system. Pathetic amateur hour maintenance. Having said that, I did not have that issue and my screen and sound worked well. The headphones in business class are terrible. I bet they cost $1 in bulk. Its a $4k ticket. After takeoff, the seatbelt sign was turned off within a minute. I don't know about the safety aspect but it was a relief. The seats were good. Due to the reviews, I wiped down my seat and table. But it did not seem any worse than any other airline. The service was great. I think the staff to and back from Delhi was outstanding. I felt like they were trying hard to create a great experience for the passengers. The food was good too. I don't drink alcohol so cannot comment on that service. No one got drunk. I think alcohol should only be free for the first or two drinks anyway. I have seen people abuse this to the detriment of my experience. The entertainment section is well below par. Went to sleep after a watching a couple of movies. Their blanket and pillow is one of the best in the business. Better than any other airline I have been on. Slept like a baby. Got to Delhi about 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Landed early on the return trip too. When we got to sfo, the gate was closed. I heard someone comment 'only on air india'. Obviously this is not the airlines fault. Sfo operations are decided by the airport. And sfo personnel I guess do not open gates before 7am for whatever reason. The lesson here is that if you travel with a superior than thou attitude, and keep looking for faults to blame the airline, then you might as well fly emirates or lufthansa or whichever airlines faults are acceptable to you. AI isn't perfect but don't take out your insecurities on them. There were a lot of families on the plane. My friend did tell me about one flight attendant yelling at an older lady. Don't know what the issue was, but passengers should at least stand up for other older passengers if they are being ill treated. A lot of older passengers are flying for the first time and need help, not anger. In the end, for me the direct flight made a huge difference, the staff was outstanding in my section, the bathrooms were kept clean, the food was excellent, I slept well, and the flight was on time. I wish they would serve Indian chai. Entertainment and headphones were bad as was the booking experience. They also announced the wrong belt number for luggage. Nothing went wrong and maybe thats also why I had a postive experience. On balance I liked the flight. They handily beat my expectations and I will defiitely try them again. Next time my expectations will be much higher, so lets see how it goes."

3) Indian Food (If you like).

Cons: 1) Absolutely no Etiquette from the flight attendants , sometimes I feel they DO-NOT have any hospitality training , or they just feel its a govt job so they have nothing to loose (or gain). If you press the buttons to call for someone , you will notice its been switched off from the control room within fraction of a second , but NO PERSON SHOWS UP.
2) Most of the entertainment monitors are broken/malfunctioning / Not functioning , the one which are little bit better ,in you 15 hrs flight you will spend 5-6 hrs just to reset them and restart them .
3) There are almost 10-15 staffs on board , and you will find them gossiping in a corner or sometimes sleeping in an empty row (I should have taken a photo )
4) They will decide whether your kid will get a bassinet or not , even if you spend some additional time to book a seat with bassinet earlier , even if your kid is allowed to get one as per his age , even if you need one very badly (children under two are not allowed to get a seat-ticket and its almost impossible to hold him in your lap for 15 hrs).......They can very politely reject your appeal by giving a tangent look at your kid and saying (he must be little over aged for a bassinet ) !!! w.t.f !! After having a log burning quarrel and after 4 hrs of the flight take off they finally showed one to me from a 3 meter distance , without even trying it in the designated place and told this has some problem and returned back . I ended up laying my sleeping baby in the floor somehow for 2-3 hrs , and rest of the time he could not sleep .

Conclusion: This particular segment is chicago-delhi is running only because of the non-stop short duration , otherwise their tickets are 150-200$ higher than other airlines , and after you enter their flight they do not care who you are , take care of your self .. I would suggest take other airlines with 10 times better service , do not think of the food , EVERY AIRLINE HAS INDIAN FOOD , you can select while booking the ticket , and one break in between is better than a continuous flight for health . Sometimes you can plan for a extra day and visit the country of Transit ."

Again, after the flight took off from Vishakapatnam for Delhi we were served light refreshment. In all, no food was served. So, we remained hungry throughout the flight. On inquiry from the airline staff on board, I was told that the flight is being flown early in the morning, hence we could not get the food packets.

I would recommend, if you are travelling with Infant or have extra baggage (more than 15kgs) to be checked in look no where else book with Air India even if the fare difference is more by 2K INR as you will gain from it .
Below are my reasons:
1. If you flight is delayed they offer proper food in Airport food court( in my case flight was delayed by around 2 hrs). I haven't received any such service even from any so called low cost airlines so far even though those gets delayed by more time.
2. Air India only offers within India 10 kgs of checkin baggage allowance for Infant and cabin baggage allowance too.
3. Air India only offers upto 25 kgs of checked in baggage and 8 kgs of cabin baggage free of cost and if your checkin baggage is more by 1-2 kgs they still waive off out of courtesy. All other airlines offers 15kgs checking and 7 kgs cabin in economy. Specially with Spicejet and Indigo I have experienced that they even ask for 1 kg price if checkin baggage crosses 15.5 kgs and they will even weigh you cabin bag.
4. seats are much more comfortable in air India as compared to spicejet and Indigo.
5. Air India offers complementary meal too :)

So, to summarize , if you have to pay @300INR per kg for extra luggage 10kgs of extra baggage is going to add 3000 INR to the ticket cost if you are travel in any other airline.
Also, Air India do not charge for seat selection in most cases. So, you can have your own choice of seat.

Note: All that I mentioned above are my personal opinion based upon my personal experience only."

Flight delays and cancellations are a routine feature of this airline, with flight delays usually lasting 4 hours since the aircraft are poorly maintained. Most of the time the aircraft is not clean and the in-flight entertainment system does not work, if ever.

When I flew with Air India, it was filthy inside the plane, full of litter everywhere. The awful toilet smelt and looked as if someone had terrorized it with a mixture of vomit, food, litter and excrement. The aircraft was visibly old and outdated because almost every part was creaking. There were many problems with the creaky, old and poorly designed seats. Some passengers even thought that they had gotten broken seats! The USB port and connectors were broken and the seat-back monitor was not working. Even the headphones were in a sorry state. I changed my seat but the new seat's monitor was also not working properly! I was told by the crew that another seat change would not help because there were around 100 seat-back monitors that were not working! I could see run-time errors and it would take too long to reboot and never come back up. The aircraft had overhead monitors too but none of them worked either. I complained to the cabin crew and they tried to restart the system but it was hopeless. The cabin crew were clueless and could not fix it. So they told me to file a complaint after landing.

Air India food rates among the worst I have been served on a flight because both the quality and the quantity were bad. Before they served the meals, a strong stench of burned masala filled the whole plane. Being South Asian, I could tolerate it but the foreigners around me were sickened and disgusted. Unlike other international airlines, there were no meal options to choose from such as vegan, or vegetarian, or halal, or kosher, or children's meals, etc. You just had to eat what you got. The food on-board was terrible at best. Compared to other airlines, the food served was very limited and in pathetic small portions. Biting into the Indian bread (paratha) felt like an uneatable piece of rubber. The rest of the food tasted very bland, inedible and stale. Some of the other foreign passengers thought that the food had gone bad and started worrying about food borne diseases or food poisoning.

Air India service is terrible, especially if your luggage is lost. Airline staff are impolite and do not always respond to complaints. The cabin crew is mostly old, rude and ill-tempered most of the time. They make you feel like they are doing you a huge favor while doing the most simple of routine tasks. One flight attendant only grunted instead of saying thank you. I didn't get any 'please' or 'thank you' from any crew member. Meals and beverages were served as if they were doing an act of kindness to the passenger. Customer service is like a typical Indian sarkari (government) office."

These were not at all met by the airline, unfortunately.
We had no problem with the aircraft used by Air India (VT-ANM) Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. The aircraft left Heathrow on time, arriving an hour ahead of schedule.
The issue arose from the crew.
One of the crew members on the aircraft was rude and unfriendly to the passengers. It felt as if the crew member did not wish to serve passengers with hospitality. I never came across such impolite crew on the many flights I have undertaken in the recent years.
The impression of our country gets bad due to the actions of the crew of the flag-carrier. It is a matter of great concern for Air India, and they need to work upon it with immediate effect."

I had to choose this flight because I had to reach mumbai from goa at very early morning and this 4 am flight was perfect fit for it.
Check in and security check took almost 30 mins. The options at the Goa airport are limited to some snacks and coffee shops.
I arrived at the airport at 3 and after the formalities of luggage check in and security were done, I was at the entry gate by 3.30 am.
They opened the gate and within the next 10 mins all the passengers were on board.
As everyone had already been on board, the flight took off 15 mins early as opposed to the 4 am take off time.
I was pleasantly surprised as till this point I had only heard AI flight being delayed with whatever reviews I had heard/read. I believe to give credit where its due and I would like to praise AI on this part even though this might be an exception.
10 mins after take off, refreshments were served at 4 am.
I took a small nap for 15 mins, and at 4.30 am, we were ready to land.
The scheduled landing time was 5.10 am and the flight actually landed at 4.38 am, almost 30 mins prior to its scheduled time. This was pleasant surprise number 2.
We took a bus from the flight to T2 terminal at mumbai and getting out of the airport after collecting the luggage took another 20 mins.
Additionally, the crew members were very polite and were doing their duties with utmost perfection.

I would like to thank AI for this excellent flight and would like to wish them the very best against all the criticism they face from the public. Just keep on improving everyday and keep doing good work as you are carrying the nations name on your logo."

The flight takes off from International terminal at Chennai and you will find yourself in quite big dream liner of the airline with some 350-400 passengers on board. Seats are comfortable and screen provided for entertainment hence enjoy yourself. Free food is served on board unlike low cost airlines. It takes lesser time than those other small size aircraft. timings may be uncomfortable for some as reached late in night.

Upon boarding there were signs we were on an older 787 aircraft showing some signs of wear in the cabin interiors. Seats are fully flat beds but best for those under 6ft (183cm) in the length department. Duvets distributed were best used under you to soften the firm bed and a separate blanket was ample to cover you. Amenities included sockettes, slippers, eyeshades and nicely packaged amenities kit with moisturiser, eau de toilette, lip balm, hand sanitiser, soap, mirror, toothbrush/paste. Bottled water had been in our seats on the previous sector but not this time and not distributed - given on request only. Sleeper suits not distributed on this 12 hour plus day/night sector but given on request only.
We started with lunch ex DEL with choice of 4 mains from a lunch menu, then a set dinner about 4 hours later (Indian inspired). NOTHING ELSE was offered for the rest of the flight and we left the flight at 0715hrs famished in SYD. Cannot understand why a breakfast was not offered or served into Sydney although breakfast had been mentioned by a crewmember at start of flight. Can't help wondering if it was a crew decision as cabin service appeared to tail off as the flight ensued.
Noise from the galley forward of the cabin was quite high throughout flight - voices and equipment. We were in 2DF second row middle and ear plugs might be a useful addition to amenities kit.
Would we fly Air India Business again - at the price point we paid would probably consider it."

First of all before book the flight I send an email to the contact in spain asking how does checking a bike cost. No one answer my question.

When we were checking in in Madrid they told us that we have to pay 100€ per bike, I want to let you know how many cost it.

But the worst problem were when we were checking in in Kathmandu.

We were 4 people with 4 bikes. They told us that we have to pay 150€ per bike (in Madrid we pay 100€)....and for our surprise!!Air India doesn't let us pay with CREDIT CARD!!!The ATM in kathmandu doesn't work....while we were looking for an ATM they told us that they were going to close the checking in desk.

Finally they facture the 4 bikes. And they tell us that we will pay in our transfer in delhi airport. I don't understand why they didn't give us that option when we wanted to pay with credit card.

We could flight because our 4 luggage already were checking in. And was easy for them to checking in us that look for our luggage and give it back to us (the flight can no take off if there is a luggage without the one who check it).

When we arrive to delhi the staff of air india was waiting us to pay the 700€ ( they told us that we have to pay more because 2 of the bikes boxed were more than 25kg). So we pay for 2 bikes 300€ and the other 2 bikes 400€. When in Madrid we pay 400€ for the same 4 bikes). I don't understand why they tell us 600€ and then 700€.

The staff ot air india was waiting us to pay. We were prepared to pay with CREDIT CARD. and we were surprise because they told us that they have to go to the other side of the airport to use our card...and that we couldn't go with the assistsnt.

They told us that they will phone us to tell them the SECRECT PIN of the card in the moment they were with the dataphone.

I still can't believe this!!was increredible..I am so indignant. We were waitint more the 1 hour without my CREDIT CARD.

We have to cancelled out credit card after pay the 700€....we were afraid thst they can use it.

There is no a policy about special equipment in the air india website, no cost, no kg, etc..

Morever the plane was very old and dirty. The USB conectors were broken. And food was very basic and without options to choose.

Try to avoid thid airline. I can't understand how can be a member of star alliance group.

Hoping my opinion helps someone not to have the problem we had.

Wish some of the staff of air india keep in touch we me to present their apologies for all this situacions they create."

All of the fluff was included i.e the cosmetic bag, the booties and socks , and while I had heard about the Nite Suit or PJ’s, it’s packaged arrival was an added bonus. The rush was on to get to the bathroom and change. Food was served and while I was not particularly hungry I wanted to see what was on the plate.

On the morning of my flight from London Heathrow to Newark Airport, I received a message saying that the flight was delayed by 6 hours to 9pm. After checking a couple of times online, I then received a message to say that the flight was fully cancelled. I called the customer service line and was told that the next available flight that they could put me on was FIVE DAYS later. My wife, seventh month baby and I had to be back in the USA sooner and so I had no option but to book another flight at a very high cost, and change various arrangements including hotel stay, car rental and work meetings.
I have since been passed from department to department, with not a single person able to help me with a request for compensation from this lamentable experience and the huge expense I have incurred as a result. My emails and phone calls are just being ignored, and they are treating a long standing Star Alliance customer with absolutely zero respect or acknowledgement.
I wholeheartedly encourage anyone considering Air India to book with any other airline whatsoever. It has been the most miserable experience I have ever encountered with an airline, and because they cancelled their flight with no viable alternative option, I am now left with more than $3000 out of pocket and no replies to my emails.

I was able to get a ticket from Mumbai-Ahmedabad at just Rs. 1400. Travelling by Shatabdi or Doronto costs around 1100. So I was more than happy to pay just this much. The only worst thing about this is that you need to go to the T2 terminal (new International airport) even for domestic flights. One plus point is that Air India allows 25 kg check-in luggage per person instead of the usual 15 kgs. The check-in and boarding were smooth and hassle-free.

The plane was a refreshing Airbus A-321 instead of the usual and common A320. This was much longer, had business class in the front, the seats were a bit wider I felt and there was more legroom too. The condition of the plane was also quite good from the inside. The flight departed around 10 mins earlier than scheduled time and hence, arrival was also before time. Complimentary meal included half veg sandwich. Yes, HALF, and it only had cucumber and tomato, thats it. 1 ketchup, 1 juice and a bottle of water is what you get for free for each ticket.

Once again opted for the veg course of vegetables with rice and rajma followed by dessert and tea. The quality and quantity of food served aboard this flight was excellent. The fact that steel cutlery was used instead of plastic forks/knives was quite impressive. Would fly again with Air India and recommend this."

Had a good experience on a London -Bombay flight too. Based on these, I booked 2 Biz class seats for my mother and myself to SFO. Paid INR 2.4 Lakhs per seat for a direct supposedly flat bed. The airline confirmed it was 'flat'. However, once on that flight, we found that the seat was not and furthermore it was narrow and very uncomfortable. The aircraft was obviously old, dated as almost every part was creaking. To add to our woes, the food was surprisingly stale. And then the stop at Delhi on out return at a poorly managed lounge. Awful food and dirty toilets. Despite many many emails to track down AI Sales Manager who was instrumental in making this booking, we get a template response after many follow up emails. Not only was Air India unapologetic, they did not deem it necessary to compensate in any way the ordeal we suffered. I was not expecting a full refund but surely they could have subsidised the rate befitting an Economy seat as that it was. Unfortunately, that trip made my mother vow she would never travel to the US again as the discomfort added to her health issues which she has not recovered from as yet"

The only reason to give a rating of 2 is just for the size of the aircraft and the food served on board.
Even though the plane was big, it was too old and no instrument's on board worked properly.
And next major drawback is the service on board.

I WILL add one silver lining to this.

1. Air India has been plagued for many years with constant losses, politicians, risky flight captains and poor administration. However, the Airline is making a come back in a very new way.

2. On my recent trip to Bangkok, I decided to give Air India a nod as flying Bangkok Airways was a poor experience earlier. I must say that the ground staff and the inflight crew were very accommodating.

3. Air India flies its latest fleet to Bangkok; the Dreamliner 787. As compared to Bangkok Airways, Indigo and Jet Airways (737's), the Dreamliner is a much modern and spacious aircraft. The seating in economy is well placed with sufficient legroom for a 4+ hour flight. The windows are much larger than other aircrafts giving a good view when taking off and landing.

4. The vegan food and non-vegan food is much appealing and tasteful for passengers of the Indian origin as many Thai based carriers serve fish which makes the entire cabin stink.

CONS:

1. The only issue with Air India is that they are known for flight delays as experienced in India as well as Thailand. So better check the flight records for the past week and you will have a clear idea.

Overall, looking forward to the privatization of Air India as it will surely make it big once again with a proper management and administration team."

I did not have to ask once on a full flight for a refill...he was always spot on. His reserved friendliness was so professional and courteous to a fault. Aside from fab training i think he knows hospitality from an instinct. It was not just about me but i noticed he was secular in his treatment to all fellow passengers around me effortlessly. rohit Sharma was a star again with that beaming welcoming smile and soft nature.

Once during a seven- eight hours flight do they serve drinks from the trolley! Be aware if you have a peanut allergy since this is the snack served with the drinks. The trolley goes out about one hour before the meal comes and that's it! The meal is very simple and tasteless. Breakfast is a very small, toast and a pre packed juice and does not include coffe or tea.
Staff does. It check toilets and refill toiletpaper if needed. Staff looks very disengaged and I overheard a customer complaining about his screen not working and the way they handled it was extremely poor. No excuses or trying to apologise instead they threatened to call security?! Perhaps I did not hear everything but it did leave the rest of the passengers with a slightly uncomfortable feeling.
Connections in Dehli where extremely messy with long queues and no support in ensuring you actually make the connection. On my way back I missed the flight to Bengaluru and the handling was really poor. Perhaps governments should not run airlines? No one was engaged at all.

We were served two meals on the flight. One was chicken with a tomato sauce and vegetables and the second consisted was some form of wrap with vegetables inside. Whilst the main part of the meal was of a satisfactory nature, any trusting coeliacs would be caught out by the addition of the peripherals; The first meal was presented with a sachet of red sauce, which upon reading the ingredients list, contained gluten and the second had a chocolate bar which also contained gluten. Not a big issue for us because we always check the ingredients, but a flight is not exactly the environment that you want to be exposed to gluten and raised the issue of whether Air India actually understand the nature of gluten free food. For another trusting coeliac this could have caused serious issues.
Comparing the experience to other flights, we did have to ask for the gluten free option, rather than be identified by the flight crew and presented with the meal automatically, which was not a big deal. I would also add that the staff on the flight were among the friendliest that we have come across and could not do enough for you.
Overall, putting aside the chaotic nature of the majority of passengers on the flight (lots of kids running around), Air India did a great job…just a shame that they are not a little more on the ball with the finer details."

Economy",First and last time with Air India,"I thought the price was reasonable at £390 for a return ticket to Bangkok until almost everyone I spoke to in Thailand had paid the same money to fly with Emirates or similar much better quality airlines.
The aircraft was dirty on all four flights and so were the pillows that they provide which aren't much use anyway.
The food was dreadful and gave my travelling companion food poisoning on the way out and the meals I requested were not provided anyway so it was a bit pointless me choosing in advance.
They gave us a maximum of 2 small drinks in 12 hours! I buzzed and buzzed for an attendant on our return flight as all I had was a small can of diet coke and nobody came so all that time with one can and one tiny bottle of water which really is not good enough. Plus the drinks are poured out of bottles on the trolley which I feel is unsanitary.
The TVs are temperamental and only 1 of the 4 flights had a phone charging port that worked.
The toilets were in a disgusting state from other customers and everything generally was uncomfortable and dirty or barely worked.
The stop over in New Delhi was also hell I would never go that airport again or even India the way we were treated by staff and members of the public was horrible and made us uncomfortable. We were constantly stared at, dismissed if we asked anything and even people on our flight kept taking pictures of us! I know this isn't down to the airline but it happened on every flight and it was just very uncomfortable.

Never ever again - what a horrible experience."

Flight AI 333 from Bangkok was scheduled to depart at 08:55 and arrive at 12:00, our connecting flight to Birmingham was schedule to depart at 13:05 giving a 65 minute transfer time.

We were notified by e-mail the day prior to our flight to say that the flight was delayed until 09:30 due to 'technical reasons'. However our connection to Birmingham was still shown as valid.

On arrival at the airport the flight was showing a departure time of 11:20, on querying our connection we were told it would be sorted out in Delhi. Eventually we left at 12:31, with no reason (or apology) given for the delay.

Given the 3 hour plus delay in Bangkok & 4 hour flight we expected that our onward connection would have been organised on arrival at Delhi. This was not the case.

There was no assistance for transfer passengers, who had to find the help desk by themselves. At the desk the Air India staff were rude & unhelpful, taking 2 hours to eventually rebook us onto a flight to Heathrow When asked why alternative options had not been looked at we were told that Air India would not book passengers with another airline and that looking at routes via the Gulf was 'too difficult'..

We were not offered a hotel room for the 13 hours to the departure of the Heathrow flight, but eventually given access to the Air India lounge. No food vouchers were offered, the food at the lounge was stale and inedible. Requesting access to a phone we were told this was not for Air India to provide and WIFI access was only provided on request.

Our experience of the 4 flights we made with Air India was that the inflight entertainment consuls generally did not work properly. the headphones were also very poor.

We eventually arrived at Birmingham, after a minibus ride from Heathrow (supplied by the airline) 17 hours late. Complaining about our treatment we were informed that no compensation would be payable as Air India are a non-EU airline and that the timetable is 'for information only'.

As a frequent flyer you can only judge an airline on how they react when things go wrong and their service on this trip was woeful."

Recently I traveled by Air India for a short distance flight from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai and got saddened seeing an excellent Airline of one time in poor shape today.

The worst politics and favourisam spoiled an excellent air line to a poor class in last decades. Public unawareness and shameless behavior is also a contributor to such condition of one time excellent airline.

I have very high regards for Air India and feeling sorry about it's today. The staff in my recent flight was excellent. They handled a careless pax very well. Would it been such passenger in other intl flight he could have been behind the bars by this time. I appreciate the patience of AI crew who handled him carefully. The pax travelling by AI flights should care for National Airline of India and make us feel proud internationally.

The pax before us spoiled the seat so badly that my son suffered his travel a lot even after using blanket on his seat. Such pax spoils the joy of other pax and name of AI team too.

My over all experience with AI is getting negative. I wish Govt. of India and Indian Citizens travelling by AI contribute to bring back the same AI who had a Maharaja Services in past."

Inspite of blocking an aisle seat in the middle, on arriving at the airport and boarding the aircraft, I was shocked to see that the Boarding card mentioned my seat as 52 C, the last seat on the last row of the aircraft with very poor leg and luggage space.

I was in for a more shocking surprise after the flight took off. The Inflight Entertainment was non operational and I had to complain to the cabin crew 4 times. The system was reset 4 times but of no avail. The cabin crew expressed their helplessness at setting it right and asked me to lodge a complaint after landing. How I spent 15 hours of travelling without any entertainment cannot be imagined or gauged. It was sheer torture at its worst. Since the flight was totally packed, I was not even offered another seat or alternative.



The cabin crew, status of toilet etc were not befitting an International Airline. Refreshments were served as if giving a favour to the traveler and snacks only on specific demand at the counter."

Not just out of a patriotic bias, but because I know that being a national carrier it is roped in to service by the government for many important and critical national level matters that could distract attention from working on customer experience related improvements.
Another good thing about this airline is the many direct connecting long distance flights it offers.
This was my first ever trip with Air India. I reached the airport with some Apprehension as this airline is in the news for all the wrong reasons- quality of staff, delays, operational inefficiencies, old planes etc.
But when I entered the plane, I liked the colour scheme- orange-ish providing a warm and energetic ambience. As I settled in, I found the staff rather warm and willing to help. I am yet to see an airline where the cabin crew brings so many cups of tea with a smile- and that's even after first round of beverages already offered. Many passengers( all Indians) were merrily pressing the help button to summon the staff and ordering their tea/ coffee at their seats( Indians love being served stuff at their seat, isn't it? And treat cabin crew and restaurant waiters like their servants). I didn't see any expression of exasperation on any of the crew members' faces.
Another thing I liked was that the breakfast was served with REAL cutlery- yes, spoon, fork and knife made of stainless steel. And that's so much better than those useless plastic tools thrown at us by other airlines.
And while I got wowed for being given real cutlery for breakfast, for dinner I got plastic cutlery- what a great leveller!
The food was reasonably good too. They offer Sula wine which I've had bad experience with but the one served onboard was very good.
Now for the things that didn't work and resulted in giving it only 3 stars-
1) the plane was old. The only other time I've flown in a more ancient plane was a domestic trip in Australia with Qantas
2) the screens on many of the seats had some buttons missing
3) the touch screen wasn't that great
4) on my seat, the screen would tilt but would go back to original angle soon
5) The magazines were worn out
6) The toilet experience was scary as it would flush on its own every few minutes

In a way, I found Air India to be a very good reflection of the country of its origin too- overall warm people and good food but sloppy systems and a clear lack of attention to detail which would test your patience.

Overall, I recommend Air india if you can manage to get a direct flight as their prices are almost always competitive. And also be ready to overlook the niggles if you're on one."

Less than 24 hours before we were due to fly we were told that Air India had changed the departure time of the flight from Bangkok, meaning we would miss our connection in New Delhi.

When we phoned Air India they wouldn't offer us any alternative flight on that day, only the same flight the following day. So instead we decided book another flight (which cost twice as much given the timeframe) and take a full refund, which was a good decision because when we checked the flight information we noticed that the same thing happened to that flight the following day as well, and further checks through flight history suggested this was an extremely regular occurrence.

Over one month later, and despite numerous phone calls, we are STILL waiting for this refund. So not particularly happy overall..."

The online reservation system had asked for meal preference but as it turned out only vegetarian is served on domestic flights. The Kolkata-Dhaka flight was too short for a meal service and packets were doled out.

On flight service was perfunctory....the crew did their job, that's it. Not enough smiles or politeness. Where we wanted tea or coffee was not asked but rasped out. The Delhi-Kolkata flight actually originates in (I think), but one expects that headphones would be replaced at the stopover. What I found was a used set and I had to ask, (and received), a new set.

The ground staff at Kolkata were worse. Connecting passengers were shepherded to a waiting area. The announcements made to alert transit passengers could have been more courteous and the tone more gentle. I actually felt they were shepherding cattle!

So I booked my itinerary with some qualms.

I'm glad I chose AI, but I'm also glad I had adjusted my expectations prior to boarding. Cabin cleanliness was fine, but the condition of the interior was lacking; seat fabric worn, metal seat frame visible through the fabric, in-flight entertainment (IFE) either non-functional or poor variety, tray tables cracked or operating poorly.
OK, so hardware and amenities were weak; what about service? Meals were tasty enough for economy, and came pretty often, as did alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

Most flight attendants were male and did an adequate or good job of serving, but one or two seemed kinda snippy or curt. Bags and people were efficiently loaded, and international and domestic legs of my journey were all on time.

One oddity: on the return flight, the male attendant required us to remove ALL items from under the seat during take-off and landing; he did so in a rather loud and commanding sort of manner, leaving NO room for questions or negotiation. ""It's a SAFETY matter,"" he barked, even though none of my other 10-12 international flights this year had this requirement.

So, would I take AI again? Yes, probably, but due to schedule, not due to comfort. Don't count on any IFE, but rely on your own electronic devices to pass the time. You'll be fed and hydrated sufficiently, not elegantly, and you'll arrive on time.

Basic, functional transport, with a little sustenance thrown in."

We reached airport on time, but successively the ground staff have been giving lame excuses for the delay to book baggage, which turned to be calculated lies. The scheduled departure was 12.55 noon. After protracted delay of hours, we were given boarding passes, ushered in to boarding gate after security check, where an hour of further waiting was forced on but no sight of bus or the aircraft. Some time later, we were told another lie that only after couple of hours it would be known whether the flight will take us. Neither food, nor water was offered. At the end, we had to leave the airport and take to opther means of transport. About the US trip, I wrote to Non Minister for Civial Aviation, Shri Raju, whose staff conveyed steps taken to correct, but I know it is just a routine reply. One thing I noticed with this carrier was., aged, redundant crew and ground staff looking like grandmothers, who have issues even to move, above all the arrogance, lackluster approach, carelessness, indifference, scant respect even to senior citizens, coupled with age old carriers.

Check in at Singapore was a bit poor with only 3 counter staff but aside from that the plane boarded swiftly and departed on time.
On the flight i was over the wing and the whilst the seat comfort itself with middling [aswith most airlines] the leg room was exceptional, i could actually cross my legs and didnt feel like a tinned fish!
The food was rather bland for my taste and naturally it was indian food, so if you dont like this cuisine you'll be left hungry. The drinks and nibbles werent too bad though with a good selection of spirits, juices, wine and beer.
Transitting at Delhi was a nightmare but this is down to the indian security and not the airline.
The second flight was more of the same, the entertainment is below average and doesn't stand a look in compared to emirates and the like but it was serviceable. It is definitely more designed for the local clientele though with a good selection of indian cinema/tv/music.
All in all though the flight was pretty good, definitely a lot better than what i was expecting! and it was an absolute bargain compared to most other flag carriers. All in all i highly recommend this airline."

The flight was delayed 40 minutes but arrived on time in Newark. The crew and even the passengers were very thoughtful, understanding, patient and accommodating to my family knowing were traveling with small children on a 15hr non-stop flight. I've flown United before on this same route and in all honesty did not receive the same hospitality as Air India. The flight leaves Mumbai at 1:30AM and arrives Newark the same day at 7:55AM.

Whilst checking on some details online I noticed a problem with our flights and got in touch to discover our connecting flight from Trivandrum to Delhi had been cancelled. A very abrupt woman explained the only option I had was to take an earlier flight. Interestingly if I hadn't found this out myself Air India didn't notify me of this problem until 10 days before we flew. The option we were given turned out to be at 6 in the morning. We dutifully got up at 2.30am arrived at the airport at 3am, 3 hours early as we had been advised on our tickets, to be told we couldn't go through to check in until 4am. Nothing at the airport, so we sat on a hard chair for an hour and waited.
The flight to Delhi stopped at Kochi on the way so was very long. Four hours!! Then on our flight Delhi to Heathrow there was in flight entertainment (this hadn't worked at all on the way out) the option with 'Hollywoods Latest' didn't work at all. So we were left with old films. Not very happy. One of the breakfasts they gave us was inedible apart from a bread roll with butter not even given any condiment.

On a very full flight, the staff coped reasonably well keeping everyone calm, well fed and entertained. Food is good with plentiful supplies of 3 meals served in generous helpings. The airline could be more generous with water. We managed by bringing our own water on board, but regular serving or supplying individual bottles to passengers would be better. The entertainment system worked well for us, though some passengers seemed to have problems that the crew tried to solve. Available moves were a bit limited, but there was enough for most people to chose from, and I was surprised to find that the list had not changed between July and August. The aircraft was a new Boeing 787, but showing signs of wear and tear, with some parts of seats broken, toilet cabinets not closing etc. Needs some regular checking and maintenance. Our very tall son suffered from restricted legroom, and we did not want to pay extra for an emergency exit. Air India could consider allocating extra-legroom seats to particularly tall passengers, as being tall doesn't equate with being wealthy. Overall, for the price, length of flight and volume of passengers, we were happy."

The check in for business class was very easy no wait and straight through. The lounge was the Lufthansa lounge which had the standard fare. My flight although through a third party cost £1400 £2000 less than the same flight with BA. The plane always is an A380 and the flat bed seats are spacious enough and the mattress is great for the over night flight. The only quarm I really have is the food, if you like Indian food then this flight is great, if however you want something a little less spicy or western then the food is not the best. I did also find that sometimes the amount or availability was limited.

When it was time to serve food we got a measly sandwich this was a midnight flight that was supposed to take off at 23:50 but took off at around 1 am and they had the nerve to ask veg or non veg when one triangle of the sandwich had just a slice of cheese and the other a few pieces of chicken or vegitables (my wife opted for veg)

I also asked why there was no flight from Kathmandu and was told, ""It's just routine"" I asked what they meant by that and was told again it was routine and there was no flight on a Monday. Why then did you sell me a ticket? I seethed ""It's just routine"" they repeated. I sat down again and waited and waited. i returned to the desk when there was only about 40 minutes before my flight was due to leave for London and was told to wait. I sat down and was suddenly called back to the desk and given a boarding card and told to hurry as my flight was boarding soon. It really looked like I'd been forgotten about until my last visit to the desk when ""panic"" ensued. I made it to the gate on time and flew home on a tatty, and slightly grubby flight. On landing at Heathrow I waited and waited for my bag which of course was missing. It hadn't made the connection in Delhi.

This trip was with the family, with my 6 and 5 years old.

What do I like about it?

- Ground staff was very accommodating, though we reach late and the flight was full initially Damata staff told that he is unable to provide us seats together. I requested him to approached Air India Staff, may be he can support us and surprisingly he indeed managed to give seats together.
- I am fairly tall, no complain had manageable leg space compare to other airlines where I really struggle.
- They boost their food is best in star line and no surprise there especially if you are Indian.

What I don't like?

- Aged Crew staff - I think 80% of them MUST be moved to back office as the only Govt run air line can have them on board. Though they were very kind and accommodating but I am sorry if Air India need to compete with others they need to change.

But has to wait at airport for boarding for almost half an hour delayed that is a regular feature. Though official reason given was heavy raining. Once inside nice feeling good legroom and excellent refreshment. Hot well cooked tasty well presented with nice tea. Tell me how many times you get a boondi laddoo as desert in a flight. It was Awasome. By the time you finish eating you are ready descending. Nice flight.

We were given a voucher at Sydney Airport upon check-in. On arrival in Delhi we proceeded through the transit area to the Hotel inside the terminal. Unfortunately we were denied a room at the hotel inside the Airport Terminal even though we had a voucher. There were many people in same situation and not enough rooms. I strongly recommend having a stop over in Delhi, getting a visa and booking accommodation near the Airport."

After quite some time, the Pilot announced that a member of crew was delayed because of difficulty in getting a taxi and was stuck in traffic. Then, the Pilot added something about their inability to leave without the full complement of crew, as it was (somehow) related to Passenger Safety!
Neither did the Airline try to organize a substitute, nor did they operate without the rostered crew member. In the event, the flight was delayed at the Airport for about 90 minutes or so! To my mind, there was a serious operational breach and the imputed / actual cost to the Airline (I think the craft was a Boeing 777 ER) would have run into tens of thousands of rupees, apart from considerable loss of passenger goodwill.
Considering that Air India offers higher baggage allowance and in-flight meals, they need to leverage on their strengths and stand, potentially, to wipe out the competition!
Air India may be faced with obsolescence, unless it gets its act together!"

Contrary to what you are told during check in at JFK, you have to change planes at Delhi. You get a second boarding pass in Delhi. The connecting flight to Mumbai is often cancelled or delayed, so expect a 2 hour layover to stretch into 3 hours, and, quite likely, an added hour waiting inside the plane before the doors are closed.

The Boeing 777 they flew was new, so everything was working. Leg room was about par for the course. There is hot food, but the cabin crew is more concerned with quickly finishing the job and getting back to the galley. Don't even think of calling them, easier to get up and go fetch your own water. If you want a beer in the middle of the flight you may have to wait really long. The selection of entertainment is not worth talking about, with uninteresting movies, little music, and maps that do not work part of the time. Simple announcements seem to be read out by people who do not understand what is being said, with long odd pauses at wrong times. Modern automation does better.

Business Class",Business Class on a Budget?,"I'd much prefer one long-haul flight than two shorter ones any day, so the convenience of an uninterrupted flight between India and Australia was too good to pass up. Seems it's the only one on offer, which is a sad thing. My history with Air India is not positive, so I did not have high expectations of this flight, but it had some surprises. Best of all, it's a Dreamliner that flies this sector. This is a very comfortable plane and the Business Class seat reclines to a flat bed of reasonable proportions. It was an overnight flight, so the bed was important. Unfortunately, the rest of the design is pretty ordinary; there's next to no storage built into the seat for things like phone, glasses, laptop etc, and the window light density is under the control of the staff, so not much choice happening there. The screen is a good size and quality, but the plug for the audio (I take my own noise-cancelling headphones) was really hard to find and manoeuvre. In any case, there was precious little on unless you wanted Bollywood.

Aside from the seat design, there were some more concerning features of this flight - the food (woeful) and the staff. I've flown on many airlines around the world, but I've never struck such unfriendly staff with such a sense of entitlement as we meet on Air India. Here customers are make to feel as though they are there to do the staff a favour. There's next to no sense of service to customers - if it's like this in Business, then god help cattle class.

I mentioned this was an overnight flight. One might reasonably expect that there would be an opportunity to grab more than a few hours' sleep on a 12-hour flight? But no. Shortly after the flight commenced we were given a menu that covered only the first meal. We were then fed (and the food choice was ordinary to say the least) by impatient staff who seemed to think it was beneath them to bring their customers' food, then the lights were turned off and the 'blinds' closed and we were encouraged to go to sleep. There was no indication that there were snacks available during the rest of the flight, or information about any further food service.

About 6 hours into the flight the lights came on again and we were offered another meal. There was no menu or indication about what was happening. I emerged bleary-eyed from my snooze when a meal was served to my next-door neighbour. I asked the staff member what was happening and she said ""Oh, so you've changed your mind about food have you?"". (wtf?) ""Is there a meal?"", I asked. ""Yes, which would you prefer?"", says she. ""What's on offer?"", ""Veg or non-veg - chicken"", she offers. ""Chicken or veg what?"" ask I. She said something unintelligible and I chose chicken which was duly delivered about 20 minutes later (something deep fried and awful). I'm completely disorientated by now, trying to work out what the time was. Was this breakfast and were we about to land? Should I get my stuff together and prepare to disembark? But no, as soon as the food was cleared away the lights were turned out again and remained that way almost until we landed 5 hours later. No further refreshments were offered (I had to insist on some water eventually).

Just before we landed a staff member came around the cabin and handed out the amenities kit. I kid you not! Most were left on the seats untouched.

Speaking of which, the toilets in Business Class were not cleaned at all during the flight. I alerted a staff member about the condition of one toilet well into the flight. Nothing improved...

What a bewildering experience! Would I take this flight ever again? Yes, because the convenience of a single long-haul flight over transiting for hours in SE Asia is too attractive. But I'd be prepared. I'd still fly business class, take my own food in a box, don my PJs, my ear-plugs and eye-shade (can't rely on receiving one on board) and make it clear I wasn't to be disturbed. Then I'd go to sleep and let the staff get on with making life unpleasant for my fellow-travellers.

Qantas, Singapore, Malaysia - anyone - please make a competitive bid for this sector!

I gave this review 3 stars because this is the one uninterrupted flight between India and Australia that I have ever found. I'd give one star for the experience otherwise."

Luggage- now pay attention to this. We travelled from Sydney to Delhi and although our flight to Amritsar was only the next day (literally 24 hours later), our bags were put on the next Amritsar flight. We didn't get our baggage at Delhi airport so when we contacted the Air India team, they assured us they would go find our bags and sort it in 30 mins. We waited and waited and got our bags after 3 hours from landing! The staff were very rude, unapologetic and were trying to settle their own issues with the guy who went to fetch the bags. It was not just us but the bags of 2 other passengers with us was also missing. The team didn't do anything to relieve our stress. instead kept lying to us, yelling and finally got our bags 3 hours later!

Please, please save yourselves this ordeal and pay a little more and fly a better airline know for their customer service and efficiency. It is not worth the stress and in some cases the lost bags, just to save a few dollars"

In addition the flight took off on time, which surprised me greatly. Unfortunately because of bad weather and poor visibility over Bhopal we were delayed by almost 30 minutes. What can't be changed must be endured.
However, what can be changed, MUST be changed. Breakfast was served on the flight and with the latest ruling of serving only Veg meals in Economy we were served accordingly. The food was pathetic, horrible vermicilli upma and a sambar soaked vada which tasted like cardboard. Horrible experience. Hope the airline can improve the food standards or if it can't then it could stop serving food totally. Left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and metaphorically."

Air India has one of the worst entertainment systems in the air, and that too if you get it to work. The collection of movies is pathetic and outdated.
The food service is average and certainly not what you expect in business class and on a long haul flight. The idea seems to be to get the service done as soon as possible so that everyone can go to sleep.
Most of the seats are also in a bad shape and if you are unlucky you might get one that folds flat, but refuses to come back to shape. Having taken this flight many times, I have seen my bunch of combinations of what can go wrong with the seat.
However, the fact that you get in in Delhi and get our straight at San Fracisco, that too early in the morning, makes this a very convenient flight to take. Only if the service and aircraft were a tad better."

Business Class",I recommend another airline option if you fly business class,"I travel to India for work quite often, always on business class. I usually take Emirates or British Airways or United Airlines from Newark or JFK airport. This time, I was booked on Air India. I've read many reviews online that did not have many good things to say about this airline. After flying Air India, even on business class, I have to say that the reviews were accurate.

First, the online booking managemnt system has bugs. I could not enter my Star Alliance frequent flyer number. I had to give it to the agent when I checked in.

Next, the lounge in Mumbai was spacious, but the restrooms were very busy. While I was at the sink, the attendants kept interrupting me to reach for supplies stored under the sink. The food options were limited to Indian style cuisine.

Boarding was an average experience.

The business class section had lots of leg room. However, there was no divider between seats (except an old fan type divider made of paper that wasn't worth using). The aircraft is very old. There was duct tape over many seats. Though not impairing function, the whole cabin felt tired and old. The movie options were fewer than Emirates and British Airways. I brought my own headphones, but they didn't fit into the older style headphone jacks. The viewing screen was also much smaller than on Emirates and Britis Airways. The amenity kits had nothing worth keeping or using.

The meals were limited to Indian cuisine. I actually diarheha a day later. I'm pretty sure it was from the plane food. I didn't eat anything else in the prior day.

Among colleagues, a few Indian colleagues dislike Air India. many more like it. For me, the biggest issues are
(1) The food. After a long trip, I want comfort food, any only offering Indian options on business class does not help.
(2) If I am paying business class, the options versus Emirates, British Airways, and United are much better.
(3) The cabin on the Mumbai - New York route is old and dated. Certainly not a comfortable experience.

Service was friendly, and the flight was on time. That's about it."

On the onset, I had trouble. The flight was going to be delayed at Departure by 2 hours. Here is my step by step story for m July 28, 2017 journey.

1. Got a Call from airline and an early notification of delay. Good communication

2. At the counter. I told them that I had a connecting flight also via Air India. They put me on a very late flight arriving at Mumbai at 12 midnight. My original connection was to arrive at 7:30.

So now I am stuck one night in Mumbai - the airport staff was not at all helpful. Just smiles and said sorry.

If you are going to say sorry. Provide some customer service and value for the loss to the customer that you have caused.

3. Delayed by 2 hours - no lunch food voucher. Randomly some pax were given sandwiches. I did not ask. So they did not give me one. So no lunch for me.

4. Delayed flight was to leave at 1:30.
It was stuck at the gate till around 2:05. No announcement from captain about the further delay. Atleast he should keep the pax informed why we are waiting for so long.

5. No adjustment in food service schedule to accommodate delay.

First meal seated around 3:30 on and second meal at 10:00 pm when most people were trying to sleep and had to be awoken. They should adjust service time taking into account the 2 hour delay.

6. Meal was tasty but very small serving.

7. One meal had creamer but no butter. Second meal had butter and no creamer.

8. Very poor selection of movies. Few new ones and just a few classic. Very old ones from 1990 or earlier.

9. Broken foot rest. Does not follow FAA regulation. Could not be put up.

10. Broken remote. Only touch screen. And that too works after multiple taps. ISB charging port was also broken on many seats.

11. I got hungry on the flight around 7 pm. Pressed attendant call light. It automatically Switched off after 5 mins and then tried again. Still no one came.

I went to the back. Both attendant were sitting down resting. They are saying that they are not getting notification. It is not working.

Well, If not working. They walk around and ask if the pax need anything.

12. I asked them for some food. All they had was a packet of peanuts. No sandwich. Not even some chocolate or biscuits.
You are running a 16+ hour direct flight and you don't stock anything in the pantry.

All in all it was very poor experience. I will think twice before hopping on a Air India flight.

Tip to passengers. Make sure to take some extra food with you.
Tip 2: better take your own entertainment. Very little movie choices."

The check in was smooth, a big plus. The boarding experience on the other hand was simply painful, not on account of the wait or the double screening of hand luggage, but the inefficiency of the staff in informing the passengers about the procedure. Passengers were left guessing what was going on and ended up crowding in front of the gates or standing in multiple queues, with had luggage in hand praying for the torture to end.

Once barding was done, things went on as usual. Food served was hot and considerably good, the seats reasonably comfortable, leg room was as cramped as ever. This time on I ensured I did not waste my time trying to call the attendant for anything at all. (On my flight from Newark to Mumbai I tried calling the attendant six times just for some water, in vain.)

The announcements made just before landing at Newark seemed so bizzarre, the lady announcing seemed to have no clue of what she was saying. So do listen to the announcements, but ensure you as the attendant who comes by in case you have any doubts.

I had already watched quite a few movies on my earlier trip, so did not have much choice, yet gain the MAPS option was not operational for most of the duration of the flight."

The seats were fairly comfortable, can't say the same about leg room though. Midway, I tried calling the attendant for a glass of water and pressed the button six times in an hour, there was no response; the light that went on surprisingly kept going off promptly, indicating the call was attended to. I managed to get a glass of water when an attendant happened to pass by an hour later.

So if you do choose to travel, set your expectations right. You want decent service, travel first or business class. If you think you can manage without troubling the attendants and can be happy thinking about the direct flight and decent food, travel economy.

If you've made your reservations well in advance, paid a reasonable fair, and chosen a decent seat , I'd say it is not a bad deal."

We reached the airport well in time and went to the gate of departure, only to be told the gate has shifted and no one knew where! It was a bit nerve racking since it was the first time I was traveling with my kids, sans hubby. Anyway, close to 20 minutes later, some bored looking chap saunters close to the desk and informs everyone about the new gate of departure rather lackadaisically, not that that is a crime but a bit of alertness would have been better appreciated.

Once in, we were sorted easily with laptops and in-flight entertainment. I'd heard horror stories about the air hostesses of Air India, but frankly nothing could be farther than the truth. The ones who served us were extremely courteous and helpful, from getting medicine to endless cups of water through the night.

The food was quite horrible, absolutely unpalatable. My sons refused to eat their non-veg fare, and the hostess offered to get them veg food, which they declined at that time. Later, they obviously got hungry and the ladies got them food even without my having to ask. They just came to the seat with trays and said ""You boys must be hungry - see if you like anything from the veg options"".

To a mum, that was impressive. I'd travel again thru this carrier, that's for sure."

I have travelled Air India many times and taken advantage of their ‘airport upgrade’ service whereby once can move from economy to business for a relatively reasonable fee. However, this trip I received a mail in advance saying I could arrange over the phone to increase certainty of a seat within 24hrs. I thought fantastic – but in hindsight I wish I had never received the mail. After the first 20mins phone call they advised I was too early and so arranged call back. This was executed, but done two hours later and so again not within the 24hrs so another wasted 20mins. I called back the next day to arrange and 20mins later was advised it was completed and would see new ticket issued. It didn’t come but my CR card notified of a transaction and so I assumed all good. I got to airport ready to have an easy journey with no fuss. First off I was advised no upgrade been done, no record. I showed CR Card and asked them to sort out whereby everyone walked away and left me for 10mins until I insisted in speaking to the most senior person. The Duty Manager Mr Abhishek Bana has not a single ounce of customer service in his body! No acknowledgement, no sorry no apology. After another 15-20mins they tell me the transaction was cancelled and refunded as they forgot to charge the GST. And so I should pay again! At this stage again no apologies or acceptance that this was their problem not mine. Then I had to go to another area and pay again with no service and no priority! The whole diabolical experience took at least 45mins and left me so upset I cannot even start to share with you. The staff should be ashamed to say they service customers; this is lead and enforced from the top ! This is made even worse for me as I have worked for an Indian company for 10years and I know service is avail with a capital S in many places. The only positive comment I can share is about SB Yadav who quietly apologized – thank goodness 1 person (as well as the flight service staff who are very good) out of the 15-20 people on staff in the Delhi aiport knows what it means. Perhaps it is Mr Yadav who should be promoted. My advice to all unfortunately is to avoid this airline if you can"

This clearly shows lack of proper training and lack of enforcement of service deliverables. There is no quality control / check, no service quality check and no regard for customer whatsoever. e.g. my friends and i boarded the flight from nagpur to mumbai and the flight was so dirty, there were so many mosquitos in the flight, and the ac was not working at all. When we complained the air india staff dint even apologize for inconvenience, the only thing they told us is, this is our customer complaint email and phone number, please complain there. we cannot do anything. LOL !!! all we could do is laugh... cant expect anything better from a govt. run airline anyways. But i still fly with them, out of no choice, some routes are only covered by them and sometimes their pricing is really pocket friendly, Maybe it is a necessary evil and we have to deal with it."

We pre-blocked our seats from Air India website and selected three seats in the third row.

On reaching the Airport, we could easily reach Air India desk where getting boarding passes and check-in of luggage was hassles free. Air India staff is around for any needed help. We completed all the checks and formalities and reached the aircraft.

All these times the cabin crew was very caring. They passed by and checked for our comfort and provide us with water. One fellow passenger requested for a blanket, which was provided to him promptly.

Aircraft: As per our knowledge the aircraft was Airbus A319(twin-jet). Aircraft was clean and well arranged. Need to say that we felt the seats were slightly big and more comfortable than some other aircraft. It definitely had better leg space and seating comfort. Seats were colorful in alternate Orange and Red colors with the signature “MAHARAJA” welcoming everyone. This was really a WOW!! effect. There was apt lighting and cooling in the aircraft. All the passengers were given some options of news papers and magazines as entertainment. All the seats had the controls for audio and video settings, however, it was nonfunctional.

The aircraft had 8 first class seats that were separated from the economy section by a curtain. First class seats had even better seating comfort and leg space.

The flight: As soon as the aircraft got clearance to take-off, the pilots and the cabin crew flung into action and in no time we were air bound. Takeoff was a smooth experience.

Once air-bound, the cabin crew started their in-flight service. One portion of food was included in the fare. We were served one portion of marble bread sandwich and juice. This was sufficient for our short duration flight.

The flight was comfortable with almost no turbulence felt. The majority of the passengers had a very good sleep until the pilot announced that we were nearing Bengaluru and hence they have started the descend. In next few minutes, they announced everyone to be seated with fastened seat belts for landing. The landing was again smooth and we reached Bengaluru within the stipulated air travel time."

International
Economy","Broken plane, useless attendants and a string of lies","On 9 January 2017 I had the misfortune of flying Air India Flight AI 171 from London Heathrow to Newark Liberty. What follows is a catalogue of things that went wrong with that flight.

1 Although I booked my ticket and chose my seat more than seven weeks in advance, and although I checked the morning of the flight and confirmed that my seat was the same, on arrival at LHR I was issued a boarding pass for a different, less desirable seat.
2 When I complained to the clerk, her first response was that I must be mistaken, because the system can't change a selected seat. When I showed her a printout of my original booking, she backtracked and mumbled something about how it wasn't supposed to happen, but there was nothing she could do about it.
3 As a partial sop, she noted that the seat next to my new one was empty and said she was blocking it out to give me more room. She lied. When I boarded the plane I found both adjoining seats occupied by people who had been in those seats since India. The clerk's screen had to have shown that, and she simply lied, to get rid of me.
4 As the plane filled, I saw that my original seat was in fact vacant. (Another lie) But before I could claim it, the flight attendant moved a latecomer in
5 The seat I had been moved into was part of a large block – most of the ABC seats in that cabin – whose video screens did not work, despite repeated attempts to reboot the system. Therefore we were unable to use the entertainment system at all during the flight.
6 We were also unable to view the safety video, and the flight attendants made no effort to replace it with live announcements, which is surely a violation of regulations.
7 My particular (new) seat also had defective controls, so I was unable to turn the reading light on or off, or to call the attendant.
8 Almost by the way, the flight was 90 minutes late in taking off, and no announcement, explanation or apology was ever offered by the flight attendants or the pilot.
9 In fact the pilot never spoke to the passengers, at the start, middle or end of the flight – not legally required, perhaps, but surely customary.
10 Meanwhile the flight attendants in this cabin – a pleasant but ineffectual man and an efficient but grumpy woman – were not helpful. Except for the food service, they spent the flight hiding in the galley. There was no beverage cart, no offer of beverages other than coffee and tea with meals and none at all between meals, no response to signals for help from other passengers. At one point I counted 7 blue lights being ignored in this one cabin.
11 And of course we arrived in Newark late, but that was hardly a surprise.
12 I returned home a week later to find an e-mail from Air India asking me to fill out a survey form evaluating my trip. I did, only to receive the message that I had failed to reply within the (unannounced) time limit, so my evaluation would not be accepted.
13 So I filed a complaint via Air India's website. More than six months later I have not received the minimal courtesy of a reply, much less an apology"

I was really disappointed with the quality of the aircraft they assigned to this important and prestigious route. The seats were cracked, Seats were not comfortable with some of the metal bars poking my back. There was sunlight passing through the walls of the airplane ,not sure if it was a safety issue.

I was pleasantly surprised to see young boys eager to deliver in their service as stewards. The meal timings are a bit weird though. It works fine when you have a heavy breakfast on way to Madurai since it is the right time, but return from Madurai to Mumbai is like odd timings. we board the flight at around 0115 or something so we leave home to reach the airport atleast before one hour of takeoff.

But we are given two jeera cookies and a juice tetra pack during the lunch time when we are actually flying towards Chennai. and by the time we reach Chennai it is like over 0215 and then it takes off for Mumbai after a halt. this is when they serve u heavy meals like wada, n samosa, halwa n what not... Dunno why .. may be the Chennai - Madurai fare is too low to feed people?!!

We waited for close to 4 hours to be provided a hotel room. During this time we asked for refreshments (we couldn't leave transit) and were told ""not unless you're willing to wait another 2 hours"".

The room we were provided with was disgusting. I mean brown marks on the sheet, torn wall paper, stained pillows sort of disgusting.

Upon arrival at Colombo it was discovered that Air India hadn't transferred my bag and that it would arrived 30 hours later. I had three days to do some tracking in Sri Lanka: 1 was lost in transit, 1.5 lost due to no gear.

I had reached the Airport quite early, almost one and half hours prior to scheduled departure even though I had web checked in. But, I did not regret the decision to arrive early when I saw the queue. We were standing behind a long queue trying to find out if they had any separate counter for senior citizens. One of the attendants saw that I was holding the boarding passes. So, he asked us to go to another place meant for baggage drop. That queue was a shorter one, but not really as only one counter was there for this. It was moving at a snail's pace. People ahead of me thought, and so did I, that the other queue was better. Then some people complained about it. To our luck, the number of counters were increased to three. It moved fast and we were cleared
We had no difficulty finding the boarding gate. The flight showed 'On Time'. The plane was also there. But, the boarding was delayed by 45 minutes due to technical reasons. It was announced after we boarded the plane that one of the wheels had to be changed as per safety requirement for rainy season (It had rained). The same had been done. But, the flight did not take off as it had to wait for some passengers we were to board this plane as their connecting flight. That means, another flight was delayed! I can only assume that this is not a rule and it was a chance that the two flights got delayed at the same time.
The food was to our liking. Vada-pav! But, the service was poor. I wanted water and I did not get it till the trolley for collecting the trays arrived. Hope, this was again a stray incident."

The flight from Delhi to Cochin leaves from the International airport since this flight goes from Delhi to Dubai with a stop over in Cochin. You have to go through immigration in a separate line marked for domestic passengers, they check your ID and boarding pass. The flight took off 15 minutes early at 4.55 AM .The cabin crew was very pleasant, they let you change seats after take off without any fuss. I managed to get the exit seat. The food was great, AirIndia seems to have lot more legroom than other airlines. The aircraft was a brand new 787 Dreamliner. The flight landed in Cochin 25 minutes early.

It was a surprise therefore to find the fitted carpet coming away from the flooring in several areas of the aircraft. On 3 out of 4 of the flights taken, the headphone socket was only allowing sound through one ear. I tried both with my own Sennheiser set, using a single stereo jack, and also with the supplied headphones using alternate sized mono jacks. Nothing worked. In asking for an alternative, I was told there was nowhere else to go. This turned out not to be true, as became easy to realise whilst pacing the aisles of the aircraft to escape the monotony of a pair of long distance flights.
In visiting the toilet I found the sink to be fully blocked up with various different things, and a toilet that appeared to have been neglected since departing the Boing plant in Seattle.
This certainly shows both Air India, and the Star Alliance in the kind of light that puts me off ever flying with them again. I"

However on the 30th June there was absolute chaos at the checking in point at Birmingham International airport. The computer systems had gone down (which was no fault of the airline)however when they were back up there was very little staff available to check in . There were two young men ( staff of air India) who were doing nothing to help with this .They looked at my passport and said that I couldn't go to India as I didn't have a Visa . I had to advise them that it would be best if they asked where my destination was, as it was not India but Thailand

This caused people to run to boarding due to the delay.

When we finally arrived in the plane staff were reasonably attentive. It certainly was an unhappy airline to travel with .

On the way back from Thailand there was no Diet Coke, lemonade, sprite for soft drinks .This was very disappointing.

Food was poor, totally unripe melons, croissants tasted like they were a couple of weeks old. Spankin' brand new entertainment system rendered completely useless due to dysfunctional headphone jack. My wifes headset across the isle was also problematic. None of these problems were offset by the handing out of roses to celebrate the inaugural flight. And, the flight attendants could have been taught the correct pronunciation of Dulles. It's not 'dooles'. The entertainment systems should have been checked out as I'm sure the first 10 or so rows were.
Flight attendants were in way over their heads. I spent the last 90 minutes of the flight holding my trash in my lap for pickup. Like at home, the Indians threw their trash everywhere. Walking off the plane was difficult because of the amount of trash on the floor in the isles.
Maybe Air India has a system unique to airlines in that the 'locals' helped them selves to snacks by raiding the food storage bins used by the attendants. Out of concern for safety, I secured several of the bins myself by putting the togs back in the proper positions. All in all that inaugural flight wasn't quite ready for prime time. The fault lies at the feet of management.

The three seats next to the emergency door are very narrow and since there is no seat in front of you all items like the water bottle, ear phone, blanket etc are placed on the seat and it is extremely tight fit. The only saving grace, why we opt for the seat, is the leg space which is crucial in the long flight. The first thing one found was that the reading light on that row was not working. Then the in flight entertainment system was not operational on all the three seats. The air hostesses don't come even when you press the call button. When they pass by you and you tell them the problem all they tell you is that they will reboot the system and it should be operational soon. This happened three times. The entertainment system did not operate throughout the flight and I am sure the Air hostesses were aware of that. On the return flight one of them told us that on 67% of the economy class seats the entertainment system does not work. So on the 13 hour flight the only option is to sleep since you cannot read or watch a film and the staff could not care less. The food served by AI is extremely average. I would not recommend taking an International flight by AI in the economy class to any one."

3. Toilets not cleaned
4. Food is very poor, not tasty, e.g omelet is very dry. Does not have any variety (yogurt / juice ....). On return from Chicago, the food slightly improved (may be in America, they do not make food, below a certain quality)
5. Alcohol options are almost NIL. They serve SULA wine, which is bitter. You cannot drink that kind of sour drink. The stewards do not come around. You need to go to the back of the airplane. The stewards will serve there
6. The Air India international staff is somewhat smiling/ young and affable. But if you press a call button, they will not come around.
7. Domestic air india...stiff face staff, only Veg food only. That too not tasty at all.
8. Domestic Air India, the planes are newer (Air Bus)

Really Did I?? I wouldn't deny that he didn't apologize, he did but I still wonder that what if It was a kid drinking that juice. This kind of carelessness is absolutely not acceptable. Please be careful with the drinks and food served to you, check properly before having anything.

Customer service was terrible. I have never seen any air hostess so grumpy, no smiles at all. I asked her to fill my water bottle and she told me to fill the bottle myself pointing towards the big bottle. Shook my head and filled it myself.

Seats could not be adjusted and the life jacket was popping out from under my seat.The aircraft had not been cleaned properly since the last flight as discarded wrappers/ tissues were still in the pockets and my headphones were missing. Another lady shifted her seat because nothing was working in her original one, she said.
Staff: One of the airhosts was very rude to some of the passengers and did not seem to show much sympathy towards a passenger who was travelling with a mentally challenged relative. Another airhost was asking around several passengers to change their seats to accommodate a trio who wanted to sit together and were generally creating nuisance. One of the three kept standing even after the plane had started cruising and the airhost should have been firm and made him sit on his allotted seat. Food: The dinner provided was okay - the chicken was good, but for breakfast there was no hot dish surprisingly. One hard Danish pastry and one croissant were all that the passengers got apart from tea coffee.

Flying crew were not friendly. The snacks served on board does not deserve a mention. For a 11.00am serving of snacks, a slice of fruit cake with couple of biscuits and a cup of tea will be well appreciated, rather than dried sandwich and dhai balla which couldn't be relished at that time. Revision of menu will be highly appreciated.
Arrived on time and the baggages were on belt quickly. So no delay to exit the terminal."

Mumbai was our first destination so we booked the tickets for it. It was 2 hour journey in which Airline offered us free meal, newspaper (Hindi, English). The great things which makes me happy is leg space. It was specious and comfortable. Overall i had great experience with Air India and i would like to prefer it for all those who want more leg space for comfortable journey.

Bad part is their special assistance service. Both my parents were travelling with me.

Very disappointed with the behaviour of their ground staff. Faced this at delhi airport. At the time of return tomDelhi, wheelchair assistance was again not available. On being asked, ground staff, reply was you have to wait. After waiting for 25 mins, asked my parents to walk themselves. Worst was the ground staff advised not to travel again by airline if we are looking for better services.

The first impression I got as I boarded was that the plane was dirty. There was still litter from the previous passengers! I am however a very patient guy, so I thought perhaps they didn't have much time to clean and were pressured by tight schedules etc so It didn't bother me that much, after all my own seating area was clean...
As I sat down in my thinly cushioned steel frame - the seat (for a 9h flight to New Delhi) I couldn't help but notice a slight jiggle in my chair... The reason being it was NOT properly screwed to the floor. At this point I admit that I got slightly worried but said nothing nevertheless (if a plane will crash, screw or no screw, you're screwed). Before takeoff, in the row of seats next to me was a drunk indian man. He was already fighting with the hostess to exchange seats with someone unrelated to him for some reason. I silently prayed he wouldn't be seated next to me for 9h. Eventually he settled down somewhere.The flight itself went smoothly apart from a few turbulences where the plane shook like cardboard, but no problems other than a million children running around, crying babies and the smell of curry... Of course, don't expect your TV to work in the plane. Mine was seemingly broken, as well as the remote to use it. The arm-rest too.
Arriving at New Delhi Airport: Be prepared to show your passport and boarding pass around from the first step out of the plane. I must have had to show it a couple dozen times and wait in queues of people to pass security where one soldier would be S L O W L Y pushing your bags through the scanners one at a time (with what seemed like no concern about anything in the world) and 5 others literally doing nothing to help. Also be prepared for people to just walk in front of you in queues. Return flight was very much the same except I did get a screen which worked, but then found out the choice of films is of around 4... Also, I paid more than I did with other companies for the same destination, so I do NOT recommend."

By that time, most passengers were really frustrated. The first thing you notice upon entering the flight is the smell of mildew/mold and used blankets. The cabin was never cleaned since it's last flight (or perhaps since several weeks..who knows). Air India never restricts passengers from carrying huge bags to the cabin, so the overhead bins were filled up with bags of those who managed to board early. If you are lucky, you will get some space to keep your bag below your seat. The quality of food served was horrible. They will give you all those stuff that you shouldn't eat on a 17 Hour long flight (aloo,rajma etc). The lady who served tea/coffee reminded me of the chaiwalas in Indian trains. She was running around the cabin with a kettle of luke warm tea/coffee and was yelling ""tea""...""chai""...""Kafeee""...with a typical ""I hate my job"" face and a fake smile that most Air India staffers have.
The only positive thing I can remember about this flight is the short 17 Hrs flight time (since this was a direct flight from USA to India). I would not recommend this flight if you are travelling with infants/small kids. Book it only if you are desperate to get to India as soon as possible."

The system failed multiple times, and finally we left that, frustrated. In Heathrow airport, all self check in counter was working except that of Air India. And there was big, haoti queue as one lady was trying to address all the passengers with their douments. She was helpful but the systems were not. So we waited for about half an hour before our turn came.

Next at the baggage counter, there was another drama. We though had three tickets, we had only one suitcase and a bag to deposit. The Suitcase wasn't oversized, but was weighing only 1.5 KG more than required. Whereas the bag was much lighter. We were way below in our permissible limits of 2*3*23 KGs, total weight o the bags were about 35 KG only. Still the lady at the counter, some Ms Sahana, having terrible attitude and even worse communication; make us open the suitcase and transfer a few things to the other bag. It was completely unnecessary and we seen this only as harrasment.

Next while boarding, they announced for families with kids to come forward in. Beleive me, there were only a handful of families and they made us walk the longest pathway! Everyone in the queue was loughing seeing the missmanagement. They made kids walk the longest!

The plane we entered was pretty old, and was stinking. The seats we offered, the headphone sockets were broken. So I had to give my seat to my wife so that she can enjoy the programs, and moreover, she has the same misfortune of having non operating audio while coming from Kolkata to London via Delhi. So this time I had to oblige her and I enjoyed (!) muted entertainment programs! The programs were stale - that is another concern.

The food was below average. It was pretty late in the evening and services also started late. We requested for food for our kid - they paid no hid to it. We have never seen a crew caring less.

We were happy when we alighted and releived that a nightmare of an international flight has finally ended.

I sincerely hope this was our last flight with Air India.

I felt ashamed writing such a bad review about our national carrier. But I sincerely hope Air India gets a serious makeover, and follow the footsteps of what Indian Railway did - being a govt run transportation. The Indian Railways had a huge makeover in last 8-10 years."

Business Class",Worst Flight ever - even in Business Class,"FRA - DEL
DEL - BKK
And back

Due to fact that Air India is also Star Alliance member I booked flights in business class to Bangkok

First of all the web checkin never worked!
Whether online with PC Browser nor IPhone App - after x attempts (and searching for eticket number somewhere in the booking reference) we only received ""checkin confirmation"" but no boarding pass.

Start in Frankfurt was ok - 3hours before flight checkin was open and we received tickets for both flight segments
Then access to Lufthansa Business Lounge - as good as always (some snacks, some drinks, possibility to take a shower - but no more massage seats!?)

First flight was good - nice staff, champagne before departure and tasty food.

After landing in Dehli first ""shock"" - you have to process security checks again! Although you just have connection flight and stay even in the same terminal!
Then access to Air India lounge: crowdy and loud!
Even you have may monitors with flight departure information a lady was walking around and yelling real loud ""last call to Paris - last call to Paris""
You were not able to rest or even sleep while this noise - and stop over time was extended from 5 to 6 hours as the next flight was delayed ""due to operational reasons"" - emails was sent 6 hours before....
After checking flightaware.com the last 10 days only 1 single flight was less than 10min delayed - and that on the home base airport!

Flight to Bangkok was with less friendly staff, no welcome drink before departure and although only 15 of 18 business class seats occupied my favorite dish with seafood was unavailable - not acceptable in business class!

Also no toiletry bag was provided - compared with flight before where you get toothbrush and paste, very well smelly Eu de Toilette and some hand and face Cremes and (a not even fit able at all) sleeping mask.
I assume this is only provided on long hauls >5h flight time.

Positive:
After landing in Bangkok we received priority pass for immigration and catches a taxi to downtown 30min after touchdown.

Flight back:
Planned take off 8:55am
Again noon before received flight status update - delayed 45min due to ""operational issues""
So we could sleep longer, but stopover time was less than 1h - and bear in mind the security checks again!

Lounge access to Miracle Lounge right next to Gate - very very Nice, clean, spacious and very clean toilets (even for Asia)

Before boarding there was another security check right in front of the gate, where we had to leave our lighters - not allowed ... hm, thankfully we did not had our Zippos with us...

Takeoff was 9:55 so 1h later than planned.

Staff was little older than average but very friendly.
Even we had 1h later departure, arrival was in-time - positive.
But after landing the airport was confused and we had little waiting time for a free gate....

After then security check:
4 armed security officers looking around - 150 people waiting for check but only 1(!) officer is checking x-ray
And don't forget some stamps!
Security check, Checkin at gate, checkin at airplane ... they seem to hire stamp people!

After all we managed to arrive at gate to Frankfurt right after boarding starts - but then still waiting 30min in plane (boarding completed) until rollout

Departure 30min late!

Airplane to Frankfurt was one of the older Dreamliner - out of order read lights, old-fashioned Toilet-Doors...
But staff was friendly

But again the favorite menu was not available anymore - not acceptable!
In a Business class with half occupied by Europeans Air India has to provide enough ""non spicy"" food!

Compared to flight FRA-DEL on this flight also no toiletry bag, even no pillow and no ""nice blanket"" for the sleep.

Overall also the onboard entertainment a little aged and not up-to-date:
Beside some English Hollywood movies many Bollywood movies and some inflight information.
No WiFi, no up-to-date inflight Information - my Dreamliner flight before with United was more modern here.

In a nutshell:
Even with business class the worst flights ever had:
- No online services at all for checkin
- Bad ground services at home base Dehli - I will never ever want to go to Dehli voluntarily!
- Flight Staff depending on flight and/or daily mude...
- Not a single flight segment was on-time (either departure or arrival) but you even know a day before. ;-)
Recommend to spend some 100. Of Euros more and fly other Star Alliance Members - Singapore Airlines or even Lufthansa"

It is always reliable time bound because of priority to national carrier at all the airports. Best part is baggage allowance of 25 kgs so I don't have to worry about luggage. Leg space in between seats are more comfortable than other airlines.particularly in dreamliner. Only inflight service of food is not perfect and upto the mark. Otherwise I would have given it 5 star.

Just 10 minutes before the expected departure time we saw people were going to the counter and coming back with angry faces. As we checked with the staff, they simply said the flight is delayed by 2 hrs! and now its from a different gate!!. There was no announcement made, no apologies and the staff simply left as it was.

Flight was via Amhdebad, UNFORTUNATELY. This is an airport I will want to AVOID. You arrive from Mumbai on what is supposed to be a domestic sector, then check out, and then go to the departure lounge and queue up for immigration, and boarding.

One disadvantage I have noticed about flying 787s is that they only open 1 door for boarding so EVERYONE boards at once and there is no priority for premium passengers, which is not a major issue really unless the queues are unruly

The Indians in Ahmedabad have figured this out to a science, and I have NEVER SEEN SO MANY WHEELCHAIR PASSENEGRS boarding on ANY flight IN MY LIFE, and I am on over 60 flights every year. They must have had in excess of 30 wheelchair passengers, so they breeze thru immigration and boarding in priority.

Yet upon arrival in Heathrow, I saw but 3 wheelchairs waiting for passengers outside the aircraft door.

So my suggestion would be to avoid Ahmedabad unless you want to use a wheelchair.

Flight from Ahmedabad to Heathrow was very good, and the seat goes flat and is comfortable for a god nights sleep. Inflight service was likewise very good, almost like you'd be treated as a guest in an Indian family home."

I had booked flight from Surat to Mumbai and the expected time to arrive at Mumbai was 8.50. I had a connecting flight of Jet Airways from Mumbai to Bangalore @ 10.25 AM. There was a gap of 1 Hour 35 Minutes between these two flights which is more than enough.

The flight from Surat reached @ 9.40 to Mumbai and after that for 40 - 45 minutes the baggage did not come - due to this I missed my flight from Mumbai to Bangalore. There was no staff from Air India near the conveyor belt to listen to the passengers. I was travelling with my 1.5 years old kid and I had to spend 5 hours @ airport with additional cost of 8000 for booking another flight.

When I spoke to the customer care representative @ Air India Airport Desk, they said as the flight to Bangalore was from Jet Airways, they can't help me book another flight. They said they are only liable to drop me to Mumbai and 9.40 was the new arrival time, so they do not see any issue in that. When I said that the baggage did not come for 45 minutes, he said he can't do anything on that as well and asked me to escalate and do whatever I want to do.

I found the staff very unprofessional and did not care for what I had been through."

Recently as USA President Donald Trump issued the notice of ipad, tab and laptop cannot be carried in the carry on bags as the cabin luggage like always and to be pur through the checked in baggages if the flights are coming via some muslim countries, so we had to book our flights with Air India. We thought the experience would be good but unfortunately it was not. It was our return trip flight. On our way to Chicago, the only usp was that the time period was real short. But the in flight services were horrible.They don't give eye masks, they don't give soft drinks or liquor other than one time in lunch. You have to walk down the whole aisle back of the plane to get hold of your drinks or juices. Even if you call an attendant, they don't come to attend you. The bathrooms were still okay to use till the end. On our way to Chicago the hault at Delhi was real short but on our return it was excruciatingly long. The flight to Kolkata from Delhi kept on postponing. We were supposed to fly at 8.15pm but it took off at 12am. With a kid sitting for so long on the sitting area near the gate was backbreaking. Plus strangely there was a confusion with my one of the luggages which very easily got cleared from Chicago Airport but not from Delhi airport. They confiscated lighters which were for gifts. They said that these are not allowed. But funnily in my other baggages few got cleared. Anyway they could have cleared it after checking them out.
In our flight to Chicago and our way back to India....in both the flights the touch screens of the lcd were not working properly, in some the touch screen not working, in some the head gear didn't work,in some the remote didn't work so it became very boring mostly for my son. I actually had to see a movie without any sound just to pass time. Other than lunch dinner and breakfast there were no other food in the pantry. Plus they didnt had what we booked for. We wanted three nonveg meal. But they gave us veg meal twice for one out of three. Inspite of saying that we don't need kids meal but need only proper meal they gave it which my son didn't eat at all. The domestic food was still better with good quality food.
All in all the experience was real bad. I would never choose Air India as my next flight for my next destination. Its better to avoid this airlines and pack laptops and ipads in the checked in baggage."

The service staff act very snooty and dont seem friendly at all, maybe coz its a union that operates in this airline, just because there is an employee union does not mean you can give appalling service! Please learn, the next worst thing is, its a task to get your miles credited onto your account, even though your frequent flyer number is updated on the baording pass, one has to first try claiming by updating it through retro miles on the website, that too does not work then one has to write them an email, calling them does not help at all, they will just say update on the web. It has taken ages for me to update my permanent address with them, I have uploaded the address proofs atleast 5 times, and it still shows up as not verified, dont know what they want, may be they will learn only when they shut down business and everyone is out of a job, or a taken over by a customer centric company."

The first and economy class are in the lower floor while business class is in the first floor. The view from the first floor is exceptional , strongly recommended.

Business Class",The best business class service in spite of an unusual incident,"I would rate my business class experience with this airline as my best in my 25 years of flying various airlines. The reason is how the crew handled themselves, when an unusual emergency situation occurred over Turkish air space. A passenger had a heart attack and the pilot had to land in Ankara airport to transport this passenger to the nearest hospital. Ankara being a small airport and the aircraft being a 787 dream liner, the airline could not find a qualified engineer to qualify the aircraft to fly out of Ankara. We were stranded for four hours in the aircraft, in the meantime the captain gave regular updates and the crews went out of their way to serve us and keep us in good humor. The crew really seemed to care for the welfare of the passengers, even though I could hear some passengers screaming at the crew in the economy section. The crew maintained calm and dignity. Imagine doing that in an American airline. The passengers would be royally shunted out and put in a Turkish prison. The crew understood that the passengers were worried. A certifying engineer had to be flown from India and we were put up in a business lounge in Ankara airport for almost 15 hours. It was a travail, but the circumstances were beyond anybody's control. The business class experience was wonderful. The crew greeted us when we entered the cabin and showed us to our seats. The food was good and we were given a set of pajamas. The seat was pretty spacious and as big as the First Class ones in other airlines. This is a business class experience I will never forget in a long time. Kudos to Air India to maintain such high standards. Other airlines should learn from this airline"

We had been booked on an Air India flight to Hong Kong through Make My Trip.
I guess because they offer the cheapest rate.

We were flying to Hong Kong with a stop over at Delhi. The flight from Mumbai to Delhi had been delayed 4 times. Because of which we had to parade around Mumbai Airport multiple time. When the final delay happened the flight number was changed.

We were not issued new boarding passes with the new flight number. They simply took the old boarding passes and hand wrote the new flight numbers on them.

Due to this confusion with the flight numbers our luggage got on to the wrong flight.
On FINALLY reaching Delhi airport when we were about to board the flight to HK they informed us that out luggage was not on the flight and they had no idea where it was.

We were pretty surprised and had no idea how to deal with the situation. They told us to either board the flight without our luggage or miss the flight and pay for the next ticket out. We had no idea where our luggage was and had no other bags so we stood our ground and asked them to trace our luggage first.

I was exhausted trying to explain to them how the fault was theirs and my luggage had been misplaced by them.

Me and my sister stood by the Air India counter for 5 hours tired and hungry while they ignored us. We stood by the counter and yelled and yelled calling for the manager multiple times but we were treated with an authentic Delhi spirit.

Finally at 5 in the morning they offered to put up on the same flight the next day while they put us up in some shady hotel in delhi in the middle of the night while they still had NO IDEA where our bags were.

All in all it was a really horrifying experience that no one should go through in their lives so just a piece of advise. Refrain from this airline."
