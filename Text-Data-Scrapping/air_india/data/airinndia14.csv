Business Class",Air India domestic flight,"I took an Air India flight from Chennai to Kolkata (round trip) in the month of July, this year. The pros and cons, in my opinion are below:

Pros:
1) In both directions, the flight was delayed only by 10+ minutes, which is quite an improvement for AI.
2) I traveled in the Business Class cabin, wherein the seats had very generous pitch and width. The seat was covered with comfortable fabric, instead of gaudy leather, which felt soft.
3) The aircraft I flew in was an Airbus A321, which was relatively new and looked properly maintained.
4) The Pilots handled the aircraft really well. The landings were honey smooth, feather soft, unlike many LCCs where the landings can give you quite a 'shock' therapy.
5) AI have upgraded their buses (where there is a bus gate), to Volvos ( I am not sure, if that's the case at all airports, but may be so at major ones) from the old Tatas. It's a far cry from the Cobus 3000, but you have to start somewhere.
6) The pricing, in my opinion was decent ( I booked almost at the 11th hour )
7) The crew were ok. The grandmas have been replaced by much younger crew, who were professional. I have heard a lot of negative feedback from others about LCCs in India, regarding the crew and one LCC staffer even indulged in some WWE style slam recently. Compared to that, these people are much better.
Cons:
1) The food on the outbound sector was good, but on the inbound sector was horrible.It tasted stale. The coffee/tea was good though.
2) Even though the aircraft was equipped with IFE, It was not functional.
3) The ground staff were reminiscent of a Government office, not bothering to make announcements at all. They were never attentive. Being a business class traveler, they should have given me a lounge invite, but I had to ask for it. Left to them, they would rather not have you travel with AI."

Just be nice to the staff and thank them with a smile and they will go above & beyond the call of duty.

North Asia
Economy",Horrible Airline,"I recently travelled on an Air India Flight: AI 503 from Bangalore to Delhi and AI 306 from Delhi to Tokyo on the 8th of December. I will hope to never travel on this airline again for the following reasons:
1) My luggage weight was over the allowance by a few kgs. I was required to rifle through my bag and remove one pair of shoes which I now had to carry around for two days during the length of time for the flight. That is just ridiculous. No leniency and no caring about the customer inconvenience or experience.
2) The transfer time between flights was way too short and I am running through the airport with other passengers, plus my extra shoes, to clear immigration and security while having to go to the opposite side of the airport. I barely made the flight and had no time to eat or use the restroom. No clue about customer inconvenience or experience.
3) The food on both flights was not only inedible, it was disgusting. I would have eaten in the terminal or bought food to eat on the plane but because of point 2 I had no time. So, traveling for basically two days I had almost nothing to eat.
4) The entertainment system was not working for everyone, so they had to reboot the system. I was halfway through a movie when they did this, so I had to fast forward the movie once the system was up again. I am glad this was done for the passengers that had problems accessing the entertainment system and this does happen with other airlines but with your airline, given everything that could go wrong did go wrong, this is just one more inconvenience in a long string of incidents.
5) When the drink cart came around I asked for red wine. They had white wine, they had beer, they had whiskey â€¦ but they did not have red wine. I am trying to imagine the genius that screwed that up. Now, this is a major issue because this is the main way I relax, especially on long flights. I almost never drink white wine, I almost never drink beer and I never drink whiskey, so on a long flight there are no options that are acceptable. How can you possibly manage to not have red wine on a flight? This is a first for me. I will say that the flight attendant, after seeing that I was getting upset, agreed to go into first class and get red wine for me. He snuck it back to me with the cup wrapped in a napkin, so no one would see what he had done. While I appreciated the effort, I asked one more time and it took forever. I could see he was really not happy about it, so much so that I just gave up. This was truly disappointing.
6) The attendants did not provide me with all the entry documentation I needed to enter Japan. There were two forms and I was provided with only one. This meant that when I was going through immigration, I was told that I had to complete another form and had to step out of line to do so. I then had to reenter the line from the back. Air India does not seem to know what they are doing and Air India certainly doesnâ€™t act like they have done this before.
7) Finally, the rudeness of the staff is unbelievable to the point that in spite of everything listed above, I was not going to complain but the incredible meanness of the crew was simply too much. I had observed and experienced this throughout the flight. Case in point is that my tray table was down and I had some cups on it that the attendants had not picked up. We were getting ready for landing and an announcement was made to put up tray tables in preparation for landing. I could not with the cups on my tray table. One surly female attendant barked at me to put the tray table up and I pointed out to her that I needed to have the cups cleared. I handed them to her and in that instant, she nastily ordered me to put the tray table up before I even had a chance to do so. I do not like being ordered about and have a real problem when people do that to me. I pointed out that I was just now able to do so, now that she had finally retrieved the garbage, and that if she would have given me a chance to do so, I would have put the tray table up without her even having had to say anything. She nastily replied that the announcement had already been made and that I should have had the tray table up. I pointed out the if she had done her job and removed the garbage more timely I would have done so. A stupid conversation to have with someone who is customer facing and supposed to be providing service.
My conclusion is that Air India is a horrible airline and does not deserve any business. I will never fly Air India again and would rather pay more money to fly with anyone else. I would suggest that Air India puts their people in some serious customer respect training. They were just horrible. For my part I will be sharing my experience with everyone I can including Trip Advisor and Facebook. People should be forewarned about doing business with Air India."

On the previous day of my journey I got a call from Air India Chennai that my flight would be delayed by 10 minutes, so it would leave by 8:20, i curiously asked the person that weather I would be able to catch the connection flight to which replied that i have ample time.On the day of travel on arrival at airport the flight was showing to leave @ 8:40. Again the ground crew at kochi was saying that it would leave at that time and i will not miss my connection. But the flight left only at 9:20 and reached Mumbai by 11:40. by the time the connection flight had left.
Now the Drama Began.The arrogant staff at the Air India Counter were hell bent on putting us on flight to Delhi and from where they will arrange a flight to Jaipur and would probably land us in Jaipur by 9 PM. Since Air India has Tieup with Jet Airways , I checked up with Jet weather they have any flights to Jaipur and they had one @2:40 and tickets were available..Again I pleaded with Air India people for arranging my tickets through Jet.But to my dismay the arrogant people at counter flatly refused to do that and they refused give me my refund. They said only thing they could offer is Delhi flight which i refused and thats the end of story.
I did not gave up and started perusing my requirement. Finally two senior lady staff of Airindia came into picture and they made many no of phone calls to many persons and show real interest in solving our problem and @2:40 jet released tickets to me.
This lethargic attitude of Some of Air India staff to delay flights and misinform passengers, arrogant behavior etc are making Air India Loose so much of money for re routing passengers like us . In that flight i found at least 15 passengers who were having connection flights and some of them in International routes. Air india must have lost a lot of money on this one flight alone.Like that how many flights would be there

Check-in experience
The check-in is efficient. The time is queue is obviously dependent on the length of queue but the average time for 1 passenger is less (approx. 2 min) which I consider good.

This flight departs from 'International departures' on Terminal 3 so have to stand in an extra queue at immigration to get the boarding pass stamped. factor this time while flying with this airline.

Boarding gate
The boarding was smooth with staff being present well in advance and courteous during entire boarding process

Inflight experience
The seats are good and big. good leg room. cabin was clean and staff very prompt and responsive.

Food
Food is always good in Air India and amongst the best which I have experienced. the portion size is also very generous and better than most airlines.

The only flip side is the cost which is usually comparatively higher than the others. If given a choice I always prefer Air India over others!!!"

The portions are smaller by Air India standard but the same as other airlines. Good to see more people of diverse ethnicities after Air India has become a member of Star Alliance.
