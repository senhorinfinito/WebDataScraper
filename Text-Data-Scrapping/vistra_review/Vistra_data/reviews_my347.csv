It’s no help at all during that moment from the ground staff. Upon further checking running here and there, we were told that the next available flight out was 3 days later even though we expressed that we had a international connecting flight later in the evening.
After being stranded for 3days in Srinagar, we manage to fly out but to our surprise meals order during our booking were not served. We shown our booking order to the flight attendant about our meals orders and was only being informed about the actual situation. As a tourist and first timer if meals to a selection is not available please do not list them in your website.
To made matters worst meals prepare are not up to its expectations in terms of hygiene string of look alike hair were found on our served meals and the flight attendant did apologize to the issue.
Overall the flight attendant were very helpful especially to the chief stewards in attending these hip cups throughout our flight and an experience not to forget."

There aren't many good options in the morning from Delhi - Ahmedabad so this makes it a good choice for business travellers.

This also makes it usually an expensive and crowded flight in the morning. Most of the passengers were business travellers and had done web check-in leading to a long queue for baggage drop-in. The good part is that the staff was responsive and diverted few of us to the premier check-in (very thoughtful and appreciated) to save time.

boarding experience at the gates is average.

The inflight experience is good mainly due to the legroom which makes the journey quite comfortable and you can discount other inconveniences due to this good factor.

The food was average. portion size was small and could have been better.

Having flown with other airlines as well, this is obviously not the first choice but still a fairly acceptable choice."

One of the first things you'd notice about the airlines is the refreshing energy of their ground staff, right from the check-in counter, all the way to de-boarding the plane after your journey.
India is quickly reaching that saturation stage where due to the high number of frequent flyers, the airlines industry is become less and less customer-centric like in other developed nations like the US & UK. Amidst all this, flying with an airline that still considers its customers as guests and treats them with complimentary warm food and beverages is a welcome step. Added to that, the pleasant legroom space in their new Boeing A320s fleet and multicolored ambience inside the plane is bound to relieve you during the tiring journey.
I now make it a point to fly Vistara as much as I can."

As we had booked Premium Economy with BA we were graded the same with Vistara. We had priority check in as well as boarding. When the flight was first announced there was a call for business customers. I usually find that people do not listen to this announcement and get up ready to board and there is a lot of jostling. Not this time. It was well managed by the airline team. When they called for Premium Economy we went forward and to our delight we found we had been upgraded to Business. Very comfortable seating, menu provided for lunch and a nice meal was served.
I recognise this is a fairly new airline but I have to say both my husband and I were impressed by the cleanliness of the aircraft, the hospitality of the staff and unlike our usual internal flights in India everything was very calm and relaxed. We will definitely fly with Vistara again."

Right from Baggage Screening to Disembarking and Carousel, you guys were absolutely fabulous. I don't think I frowned even one bit. The crew were smiling at all times. Make-up was right on point. And their galleys, spotless. Even their ovens were spick and span.
You guys must be wondering how I know so many technicalities in detail. Well, I'm from an Aviation background and I understand the minute details. It was a 02 hour flight. But, the services commenced right from boarding. I personally loved the on-ground services. After Take-off, the carts were rolled out in 15 minutes(I mean WOW). The menu cards were distributed on-ground. It had our choice of meal for that particular time of flight and it was Hot Snacks.

The food was piping hot, just like it should be and no shortage. Having complimentary food service is a wish come true for travellers. I know Jet Airways does it too, but Vistara had a personal touch and no frowning crew. It beat Jet and I'm very sure since I'm Ex-Jet crew. They have a tie-up with Starbucks for Tea/Coffee service. Now isn't that amazing? I mean which Airline does that. For those of you who could never afford/got the chance to sip Starbucks' Coffee/Tea, have thanked Vistara dearly.

I miss Kingfisher Airways, but now since Vistara has come up, I don't miss it that much. Vistara is clearly rising like Kingfisher did. The only thing missing is the IFE(In-flight entertainment) systems. To add, I'm Ex-Kingfisher crew too. It was my first airline and I still love it dearly.

Vistara, bravo to the entire team. You, practically, are number 1 Airline of India. And no sooner, Jet will realise that and up their game. Loved, loved, loved you guys. Please maintain the same standards. And if you guys are wondering who am I, then all the people who're reading this review, please note, I am not from Vistara. But, I did fly for other Airlines.

Business Class",Singapore Airlines replicated with India Girl,"When we walked into the plane, it felt like Singapore Airlines replicated. Vistara, after all, is a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Tata, and it was a good experience when compared to some of the Indian airlines we have travelled on previously. It was a new plane, smelt fresh and the seats were comfortable. The flight to Srinagar was short - one and a half hours - but the crew was attentive and helpful. We could not get sparkling water as apparently the plane only stocks still water; still they tried to be helpful, suggesting alternatives which we declined. The vegetarian food was nice. The only thing we found a little unsettling was that the crew allowed someone travelling in economy to stuff our overhead baggage compartment with a large backpack and a carry on bag, forcing us to find baggage space. Fortunately, the business class was not full and we managed to squeeze our one backpack in. When the plane landed, again, the crew did nothing to allow business class passengers to disembark first. Passengers from the economy section crowded the aisle as soon as the plane landed and it was a mad scramble - almost like travelling on Ryan Air or Airasia. When passengers pay extra for Business Class, they expect a little bit extra comfort. Other than that, it was a great airline."

I was shocked to get this rude reply , on one hand she offered the coffee and on other side said it is not ready in a rude manner. this is not anticipated from very young and bright airlines like Vistara.

Check-in was smooth, and the agents were very polite and warm. PE comes with priority boarding, which was branded under the name of Vistara Priority, with a dedicated line at the gate.

The aircraft had two rows of business class with 2-2 configuration, and several rows of PE just behind it with a 3-3 configuration. I liked very much that the aircraft had a fresh, new feeling. The seats were leather and very comfortable.

A hot meal was served, which was more like a light snack. I chose vegetarian, which was tasty (unlike the mush that I frequently see in airplane food). The plate had a nice touch, with a golden thread tied around the napkin and utensils.

One thing I noticed different from other airlines (at least those that I have flied), is that passengers in economy were allowed to use the restroom in business. This is definitely not the case with my major carrier in North America, and I have rarely seen this in other airlines as well. I liked this very much (although I did not capitalize on the opportunity).

It seems that with PE comes priority handling of luggage. My luggage came out super quick, and I was off to my next flight in literally no time. All this for only CA$160, one-way!"

secondly the add says if u book online u can cancle or reschedule with zero charges , hence I asked for cancellation which wasn't free and the call centre girl bluffed it was 200/ , hence I agreed , after cancellation she said it was 4200/ and lied that she told 4000/ for the same

it took almost a week after many mails for them to finally mail to say that they wount refund the 4200/ charged forcefully from me

I reached the BLR airport with a mobile boarding pass to learn from security personnel that it was not valid and they needed a printed copy. I was already late and ran to the check-in counter to be told that the boarding is closed.
Shocked and confused I pleaded the staff that I needed to board the flight to attend an important meeting in Delhi and that I'm already checked-in. The alert staff quickly made some calls and another lady staff quickly printed both my onward and return passes. The manager then made his assistant accompany me through a staff security route to quickly get to the boarding gate.
I was the last passenger to board the plane to only see the door closed behind me and aero bridge retract. I was so exhausted in the whole process that I could not note the names of the staff to thank them. But, I do thank them through this review for their alert and friendly gesture above and beyond their call of duty.
Now on the in-flight experience, I must say that it was far better than the other airlines but only because it is a full service airline, so it would not be correct to compare it with an Indigo or Spicejet. But, the brand has lived up to its expectation with a differentiated service approach and with some good catered really tasty food. Hope to see them fly to other destinations soon."

As compared to other domestic airlines, they take minimal time for check in. If you're flying Vistara, you'll more often than not reach your destination on time in spite of 15-20 minutes delays in departure. The best thing that I like about these flights though is the amount of leg room they have as compared to other domestic airlines. Even compared to other international airlines they have a larger leg space. Also, during meal service, the staff attends to you by your names which adds that personal touch to the experience and makes one feel special. The food is one of the best in flight meals as well. To top it of some free samples at the end of the flight always leaves you smiling even at the end of an amazing trip. The price is also extremely pocket friendly as many a times it's even cheaper than the so called ""economy"" carriers of today.

I have travelled on premium economy, as it was affordable and didn't made a big hole in my pocket like business class.Must say, it provides a service better than economy and something nearer to business class experience apart from the seat comfort.

Flights were on time in departing and landing, with minimal hassle in boarding's and security check-ins. The food provided is good with a cup of Starbucks coffee in beverage adding a brownie point to the same. Flight attendants are pleasant and helpful.

The only point of concern was cancellation charges, which is more than 50-60%, as mine was a pre-planned vacation, i was left with zero chance for rescheduling due to high cancellation charges..

Overall, its a great experience with this domestic airline."

First positive for us was that we could check in our luggage at the metro station itself so travelling ahead was easy. The leg space even in economy is much better than other aircrafts (except Air India as they also have decent space). Everything was working properly and things were neat and clean. Staff is good and friendly. The most positive things is their food. Loved both the veg and non veg versions. It is one of the best meals I had on flight.
Also their ground staff is good. In fact when shifting from an international flight to inter city flight they are very accommodating with the luggage weights even when Jet Airways is not even if you have flown international with them as well and this is connecting flight.
Loved the over all attitude of Vistara and I hope they keep it up."

We flew from Delhi to Lucknow and again vice versa. Seats were cleaned and tidy and, one of the perfect hospitality by arwa, & Aishwarya. I always enjoy their non veg sandwich where as in veg is also pretty awesome.

No delay and most of the time before that adding perfection to pilots and team.

This was my first experience travelling with kid so everything went well, however it would be good if one pay attention towards meal preference. While booking only I have requested for child meal which was missed. Thinking that we have already booked meal we didn't carry any short of milk which was tense situation for us, however since it was short flight it didn't impacted much.

Crew informed they can serve the same food to them which is really a good gesture as sometime alternative work's. We took few cookies packets.

2. Seats: the leg room is good (at least for me) as compared to spicejet, indigo in economy class. Seats are also very comfortable.
4. Food: the BEST PART of Vistara. I never ever had such good quality and tasty food ever in flight (not in domestic & international).
5. Staff: staff is extremely polite, joyful. They give you so much respect. This not the plastic smile you will see in other flights. I will give 10+ for Ms. Sharhdha for her extremely polite and joyful service.

I am surprised to see AirAsia and Vistara both comes under TATA brand name but drastic difference in their services.

Business Class",Glimpses of SQ,"We arrived at the swanky new Terminal 2 of Mumbai Airport in good time. Checking in at Vistara's Business Class counter was a bit of a drag. Economy passengers were checked in without hassle while we waited at our counter. Apparently there was a systems error and they had to make several calls to verify I wasn't some militant, terrorist or something more sinister. After waiting aimlessly for a while we finally got our BPs and lounge invites and made our way to BOM's Terminal 2 GVK Lounge.

The main seating area upon entry has a nice vertical green and is in close proximity to the washrooms. You get tarmac views from the lounge. Food was forgettable and before long we made our way to our gate.

Boarding was a funny affair as well, with no announcements and everyone boarding at the same time with no direction whatsoever from the ground staff.

There were only 8 Business Class seats followed by a Premium Economy section then Economy class.
We were offered a very nice signature drink (not on the menu) to go with our starter soup & salad, chicken stuffed with Corn and Spinach and Mutton Kolhapuri finished with a Red Velvet Berry Mousse.

Landed in DEL on schedule and retrieved our luggage which were among the first to come out.

Thoughts: Check-in and boarding experience was definitely lacking, seats are ok, can see glimpses of SQ in the service methodology (the FA we chatted with confirmed that they are sent to Singapore for training)."

I told as per Airlines / Security rules, one can carry one hand bag weighing 7 kgs and a computer which would weigh around 3 kgs. I told him that I was not carrying any computer and that he should allow, But, he was very obstinate and finally, I checked in the bag.

He was not willing to listen to me and became rude after some time as he was not having an answer as how he allowed people with 10 kgs consisting of a bag and computer. It was so frustrating that his behavior would definitely make me rethink whenever I will book Vistara in future, though otherwise, the service quality of Vistara far superior than others!"

The Flight was on time, clean and well managed and the food was well presented in the environment-friendly paper boxes which are difficult to manage. Hey, it does help to reduce the waste.

I understand the booking is through travel agent, therefore is difficult to amend or cancel. But being from the same industry I know that it can always be amended or cancelled on discretion of airline company.
I was also promised that the immediate available superior shall call me back, but never received any call.

-Flight took off and landed on time.
-Checkin was very quick and prompt. One of their customer service agents stood at the help desk assisting passengers for ticketing, queues, boarding passes etc.
-On board the flight, I was glad to see the clean and neatly maintained aircraft. I am extremely sensitive about cleanliness and hygiene. As I entered the aircraft, gazing on the pantry, garbage bin and drawers, I noticed them visibly cleaner. Head rests were clean too.
-Air hostesses were warm and professional in service. Hospitality was really genuine! And I mentioned it to them while alighting. Authentic hospitality is something that is missing from the industry of late and whenever I come across exceptional service I do make it a point to appreciate. Well done Neerja and Divya + team.

The seats had good legrooms which is missing in other carriers. The ground staff were very polite and helpful. I was very happy availing the flights of Vistara along with my family members.

To begin with, the interiors are tastefully done in the colours of the royalty. Food is served with much pampering in a specially designed box with delicious food and the smart, eco-friendly cutlery. The choice of food is limited, but getting hot food in a flight, 30,000 feet above the sea, is a luxury most of us have forgotten.

The staff members are young and poised. And oh-so-efficient! Although it was a short, same-day return flight, it was a pleasant experience.

If you take this from Delhi, the gates for Vistara is one of the last, within T3. Be prepared for a 20 minute walk to the gate. That, can be exhausting!"

They board the business class and premium economy class before the economy class. The legspace available is quite comfortable for my(5.5ft) height. I assume 6ft tall people too won't have any problem with leg space. Even when the seat in front of mine was inclined, it was pretty comfortable, unlike other flights, when the head of person sitting in front of you, is right in your face.
It was mentioned that in-flight meal is included in the flight ticket cost, however I was not sure of either the quantity or quality of the meal. I was carrying parathas just in case, as my flight was around dinner time.
After take off, the stewardess served in-flight meals. The quantity was quite enough that i did not require the packed parathas and the meal was tasty too. I would suggest people to book either front rows or mid rows as they start serving from these 2 points...

Staff is theft. Prior to this also very unprofessional experince from air hostess.

I had leg injury and due to connecting flight my leg was swelling and I was not able to walk. As soon as the in flight person Ms. Mamta saw me in this condition, she came to me and offered for assistance. I was the last person of flight to come down but still she arranged a wheelchair and assistant for me. It took few minutes to get it done and she was with me and insisted to sit till its done & offered water etc.
Really it is the perfect example of customer delight and so am I delighted. Pleased to receive such quality support and assistance."

Domestic
Economy",A great flight and Value for Money,"I traveled on Amritsar- Mumbai Sector with family on June 17th 2017 (flight UK 736). It was my first on this sector as well as on Vistara. Below is my detailed feedback on this new experience.

Check-in and Boarding: Check-in was very smooth and quick. I had web-checked in with printed boarding pass so it was just a bag drop. Airport is really shabby but that’s not Vistara issue. Flight time (i.e. Push back) was 16:15 but incoming flight (UK 735) landed only at 15:50 (15-20 mins late) so I was expecting a delay. But to my surprise boarding started at around 16:10 and we were seated by 16:20, doors armed by 16:30 and push back by 16:35. Unbelievable efficiency. Flight was almost full.

Cabin and in-Flight - Air craft is a brand new A320 Neo and it was very clean with good interiors. I was travelling economy but still leg space and pitch length was good. I have seen really cramped pitches on some long distance international flights. We were captioned by a lady pilot (could not get her name) and even rest of the crew comprised of women except first officer. Otherwise we would have had an all women flight like the one AI operates on women’s day. Pilot announcement were clear and informative. Crew behavior warm and respectful.

There was Tata as well as SIA touch of “customer first” attitude. That’s should remain a USP and differentiator.
Entire flight was very smooth except for some pre-informed turbulence during ascend. Cruising, descend and landing was very smooth. Convey my feedback to lady pilot if possible. You can easily figure out name by flight number and date. In spite of an initial delay, it was covered during cruising and we landed 5 mins early. As per flight navigation websites, Flight speed at cruising altitude was around 500 mph. Seems to be little high for a domestic flight but I am not an expert on that. Hope it is a safe speed for the class of the air craft.

Food was good though quantity was a bit small. Overall it was great experience and I enjoyed every moment. Most important part was a brand image and its governance, customer first, safety, quality and not taken for granted attitude at the back of my mind."

aircraft was clean and cool.departed on time in flight announcements were good and understandable.
i shall not talk about food service because it is not LCC. on landing near the carousel a airlines executive was supervising unloading of bags. when she noticed a single lady with two small children,she deputed one loadre to pick up bags and load them onto a trolley and even asked him to reach her upto exit gate. thanks Vistara."

Domestic
Economy",Bad food,"We booked the Vistara flight a few months before our actual travel date. The reason for choosing it was simple - a timing that suited our needs and a cost within our budget.

The check in process at Bengaluru was smooth. We were coming back after a long vacation and were a little excess on luggage - for the 4 of us, the allowance was 60 kgs total, and our check-in baggage weighed 68 kgs. (we were very light on the hand-baggage though). The good thing was that the staff at the counter said that he would accommodate the excess baggage, even before we requested him for the same.

The flight was like any other, maybe with a few inches more of leg room. But nothing to rave about. The flight was also on time - 8.50 PM was the scheduled departure.

As this is a full-service airline, we expected a good dinner. And yes, of course we were served food. We had the option to choose between veg or chicken biryani. We were told the menu was special because of Eid. Being biryani lovers, we were delighted to hear this.

But when we opened our fancily packed boxes (yes, the packing was good!!), we were in for a major disappointment. The first thing we saw was some baingan (egg-plant) curry along with the rice! My first reaction was that the labeling had gone wrong and we had been served veg biryani. But then, while tossing the rice with the fork, we discovered a few tiny pieces of chicken.

The first bite made me want to close the tray immediately. But I was hungry, (I tend to have my dinner early, and it was way past my usual dinner time) so I nibbled on some of it. Thankfully, the children had eaten a sandwich at the Bengaluru airport. My dear husband stayed hungry and ultimately ate something at the Delhi airport at 12 midnight. I still fail to understand how anyone could prepare such terrible biryani and serve it with baingan curry of all things!!

Then there was a small plastic bowl of sweet - looked like seviyan (vermicelli) in milk. Except that the dry seviyan was separate from the milk. It tasted a wee bit better than the biryani, but due to the overpowering cardamom flavor and nothing else to really go for it, nobody else had this either.

If this is the food they serve, I would rather pay for the food (here too we ""pay"", except that it is included in the ticket cost) and get stuff that I want to eat, like in airlines such as Indigo and Spice Jet."

Having traveled in premium economy earlier, the seats in the main economy have adequate space compared to crampy seats in some other airlines. The flights went about in time and landed in time. Smooth take off and landing. Service in the cabin was smooth and fine with good snacks/food as per the liking nicely packed in a box which is easy to disburse and take away without having anyone to handle your packed eating stuff. Tea is served in cups separately rather than cramping up the not needed stuff in the tray. Food choice is arranged with a smile rather than being forced down your throat. Announcements before landing and for baggage claim is superb with belt numbers with hardly any delay. If you are changing your flight, you are welcomed soon after deboarding. I must say, they have taken care of everything a passenger would wish."

Domestic
Economy",Excellent Experience on Vistara,"I think this was my second or third time that I flew Vistara and I am convinced, more than ever, that this is the best thing that happened to Indian civil aviation since Jet Airways came on the scene years ago. Sadly, Jet is no longer what it was and one hopes that Vistara will not go the same way.

What is good about the airline is its sense of proportion. The courtesy one expects from a good airline is not excessive. The professionalism was evident at all touch points, with a 'human' element thrown in. The inflight experience was particularly enjoyable. The food was excellent and when an air hostess accidentally spilled a tray while serving me, she was quick and efficient in the manner in which she took care of the mess.

It is my preferred airline, if the rates are right on the day I am flying, My next flight, as a matter of fact, is on 03 July."

The smiling faces and helpful hands one finds at the check-in counter will make the journey jerk free.Inside the flight air hostess were concentrating on you only not looking away.They help you finding your seats and arranging your handbag in proper place.The food served in a very elegant vessel.Some guests got their food packed to show others the style perhaps the Vistara is serving food to their guests. The impeccable services provided on board is worth remembering. My wife wanted to use washroom. I am touched when an air hostess not only took her to washroom but made her comfortable at her own sitting place. This is not heard of or seen in any other flight.No doubt Vistara is a great airlines which take good care of needs of its guests thoroughly. Very impressed by the devotion,commitment and loyalty of all the staff members of Vistara for their excellent services.I would specifically express my gratitude to air hostesses Dipika,Vaishali.Aishwarya and Christina.

Earlier I travelled on UK986 and UK985 on 2nd (Seat 2A) of April and 8th April 2017 (Seat 2D) respectively on Business Class. During that period I felt in love with Vistara’s world standard facility. I enjoyed the high quality services rendered by the airline both at terminal as well as in-flight.

Today 22nd April ,another Comfortable and pleasant journey I experienced with UK985 Business Class (Seat 2D and 2F). Earlier I travelled alone but this time me with my spouse and little angel (our 6months old daughter). I am not covering the part of check-in procedure or lounge experience at Kolkata airport but yes all the staffs of the airlines are quite polite and good in their service.

We boarded the aircraft last as my intention was not to disturb my sleepy baby. As soon as we reached boarding gate one of the airline’s employee assisted us to board on the communicator bus to reach the aircraft to make the boarding smooth. We are welcomed with assorted Lime and guava juice and offered their business class menu card . This time the menu seems different to me rather than the other domestic carrier’s Premiere/Business Class menu. This time the menu content authentic and delicious Fishfry and with Some Roll dishes along with choices of different flavor tea and with special Starbucks Coffee. I chose to go for Fishfry and my spouse for Veg roll delight along with Coffee.

The air hostess team was leading by Ms.Bharti and she was assisted by Leena. I must appreciate their effort to make our journey much more comfortable and pleasant specially for my angel. Bharti took the initiative herselves and prepared a lovely bed for my angel, Oh!! Really its so sweet of her and proved her caring nature. I must appreciate of Leena also to take care of us in every single moment. Thanks to Vistara to keep them on board for making our journey comfortable.

Once we are settled over 37,000 feet and my angel was slept we are offered the food. We Enjoyed the food and specially I enjoyed the authentic and trendy Bengali fishfry along with chicken, BENGALI delicious GHUGNI (Bengali snacks dish made from Chana Daal with onions, coconut and flavor Bengali spices) along with Coconut water. Then we are offered with newly added Starbucks coffee. Oh! Really I loved it and had twice. As journey was only for 2.30 hours while we were enjoying service and refreshment, it was announced that we are planning to land in Pune shortly. Very good experience with Vistara, excellent staff, yummy food and overall wonderful flight I think Vistara is best airline in India according to me.

Bharti and Leena great job to make us more comfortable to travel with Air Vistara. It is a great experience overall and I shall look forward for flying with them again.I must appreciate the care you both took for my little Angel.

Yes, the landing was good and as our luggage was tagged with Golden Priority badge. We received the luggage as soon as the conveyer belt start working. The priority badge works nicely for us. It took hardly 10 minutes for us to collect luggage and to move on to arrival gate to board on the Car to move towards my home.

WORLD CLASS SERVICE WITH A SMILE, Last but not the least, it was a pleasure to see pleasant faces serving with a smile, all around, whether at check in or in the flight.

My rating is 9 ( Extremely likely ) over 10. Absolutely recommended.
Travel Tip: Go and experience Vistara’s exceptional hospitality and service standards"

It was on time and the staff both at the ticket counters and in the plane were courteous, pleasant and efficient. The food served on board however was average & the seats in Economy Class are cramped. We expected much more from an airline launched by Tatas in a JV with Singapore Airline."

at meals service time was the best, she offered Hot coffee and provided a fresh hot meal to us as the food trolley she had emptied out by the time she reached us That was GOOD service.

There have been few good and few not so good experiences with this new airline for me
On yesterday's flight I found the Cabin Crew extremely casual careless and arrogant. It goes like this at the time of dinner service I tld the Crew that I wanted to go to wash room and I may be served later. The Crew insited to serve dinner and told me to go to wash room later .
I said in such case I do not wish to take dinner.
when I went to the wash room in front zone this crew told me to wait at my seat 6F as another crew member was in cockpit and for security reasons I will have to wait and I can not go to Wash Room till she comes out .
I am really surprised at this why the other key member had to be for so long in Cockpit and how a passenger in wash room is a security risk .
I also wish to know as to what is the reason that I was forced to take dinner and hold from going to wash room in a situation when there was no seat belt sign the flight has more than an hour of flying time and also as why no one approached and asked me serve me after I came back from wash room
Why an airline of this repute treats a Platinum member as a MILD STEEL category .
Very bad and sickening experience .
TATA's enterpriseare pride of nation and are not expected to have such a poor way of service
I will only travel Vistara if I do not have any other flight option... It will be better to travel more with Air India the national Carrier where I am a Gold Member or Jet where I am a Platinum Member ...The name, Vistara, is drawn from the Sanskrit word ‘vistaar’, which means limitless expanse. I have few very bad experiences some of which I have reported and have a very careless Customer feed back the fact is that there’s no limit to arrogance poor service and being at a limitless bad performance ......

Vistara agreed a refund of unused tickets but all they did was credit me with just under £20 when I had paid in total over £700. I am now over £300 out of pocket. My credit card company say because I have received a refund even though far below what I expected they cannot do anything. I am awaiting a response from Vistara from my complaint.

Mainly because I have heard terrific reviews about this airline and wanted to fly with them. My flight was the second leg of a DEL-BOM-COK flight and that was the day of numerous delays at Delhi due to fog. Got the alert that my flight is rescheduled and will now depart at 2:00 PM. However I planned to go to the airport at the usual time and check out the T2. When I reached there once I entered the terminal, I was welcomed by some very cheerful staff of the airlines and guided me. Though delay was not welcome, Vistara had arranged for a complementary lunch to all it's guests travelling by that flight. Lunch was nice and in the mean time the flight was rescheduled 3 more times to a final 3:30 PM departure. Did some plane spotting during my stay there and finally my plane arrived at the gate. I was welcomed to a clean and well maintained aircraft by some most cheerful and pleasant staff. The cabin crew made sure of a real quick boarding of pax and doors were closed within a short period of time. The plane then crawled through the congested Mumbai airport and we got airborne at 4:20 PM. A short while into the flight, the famed food service started. We were served with some lip smacking pav and chicken keema along with some fruits and choco brownie. All the pax were kept engaged by serving one thing after the another. As we finally finished our meal, we were already descending to Kochi! By the time I reached Kochi it had become my most favorite airline ever. The crew and their service is world class.

Economy",Cant recommend them due to its unruly customer service!,"It was my first flight with Vistara from Kolkata to Bangalore, and to be honest I was quite sceptical at the very first moment. It went all very nice starting from pleasant crew behaviour, with good/average inflight food, reaching on time. And I was very happy and decided to fly back with Vistara again. And there I did the mistake it seems. As usual I did web-check in and booked my preferred aisle seat beside my brother. At the onset problem started, just 15 mins before scheduled boarding time they declared its running late and finally it took off nearly 1 hr late and suppose to reach Kolkata post mid night. Post boarding I tried to take a nap after a long tiresome day, and I heard my co passenger insisting me to change my seat with his. I politely declined the request. It didn't stop there, I found one crew member started pushing and arguing me why can't I change my seat with the co-passenger?? I replied her that I am not interested to do so and if she is so sympathetic about other passenger why can't she upgrade the passenger to vacant business class seats ( all business seats were lying vacant ).

She promptly responded, no mam , its of higher cost. I said if you know that, you better should also understand while trying to help one passenger, a crew is not suppose to irritate and force other passengers to change already allocated seats. After my strong denial she stopped, and finally shifted that passenger to some back side seats.
Food served as a dinner was no less, it couldn't even fill the stomach of a child!

I was surprised at this crew's behaviour in spite of running 1 hour late in night, they were in no mood to apologize rather with so much zest to help one passenger, they forgot about the convenience of other passengers. What sort of priority sense this airlines have I am wondering!!"

Economy",Excellent service,"In the current domestic airline services available in India Vistara has stood out to be one of the best. A new comer in the service has been really good with its services. The seats have enough leg space and also the head rest does folds in to provide rest sideways too.

In food they do start with juice followed with Veg/Non Veg food. The food was hot and also of good quality. The air hostesses were really friendly and helpful. There were instances when a glass of juice fell because of a kid and the air hostesses were really prompt to clean and also provide another glass of juice. Also these food items are all included in the ticket charges. So they are free as the ticket prices are quite similar or even less than Indigo and others.

They do maintain time and are quite punctual with take off and landing. In fact i reached half an hour before time.

These all additional services might be provided to attract customers in the starting but would suggest Vistara to keep providing these services so that they can hold on to there customers as well.

Other classes do provide more leg space and better food facilities."

Economy","No one will help u in emergency, highly untrained staff","Fortunately the accident did not happen with me but unfortunately it happened with the passenger sitting just in front of us. He was sitting in the middle seat. Before takeoff his aisle neighbour was working on laptop. The on duty air hostess almost snatched his laptop and threw it on the cabinet above as the aircraft had started moving before his laptop was completely switched off. She had actually put the laptop vertically (most inappropriate way to keep such a heavy electronic item in a moving wagon). It shows to what extent they lack in basic training. Even a common man knows about the hazards of keeping it in such a risky way.
When the flight landed, as the laptop owner stood up, the man seating in the middle chair shifted to the aisle seat by then. Just as the other person standing in front opened the cabinet, the laptop fell over this man's head very badly and he started bleeding heavily. We all were shocked to see him bleeding that way. But even after crying for multiple times, none of the crew members came along for help. The passengers helped the victim to the airport to see a doctor. Mind you, he was bleeding very heavily. But the doctor (we doubt whether he was even an MBBS) said right away it was a minor injury. He did not even care to do a xray. And needless to say the flight crew disappeared in no time. The doctor was only interested in washing his hands off from the case, always trying to push the victim out of the airport premises at the earliest.
It was our first flight with vistara. If this is the level of training and support by flight crew, then why do u employ them? DO we really need so many goodlooking heartless humans inside the flight? Better u remove them asap and increase our baggage weight limits. It will actually help the passengers. I will never travel again in vistara and also would not recommend it to anyone."

Domestic
Economy",Rubbish airlines,"Utterly rubbish airlines. Dont really know why people here are going ga-ga over it.

The only good feature is its 20% more legroom than other LCCs,but apart from that its rubbish.
Firstly,it's never on time. unlike Indigo, it is always delayed. I traveled on a Vistara flight in the late afternoon from Kolkata to Delhi. It started pulling away a good 10 mins delayed,then waited at the runway,and then left Kolkata nearl;y 15 mins late than scheduled.
The air hostesses are a smiling lot, but it is all fake. Indigo or Spice airhostesses do not smile, here they do smile and say 'welcome aboard,Sir' but that is about it. Their body language says 'get on with it,I am off in the next port of call,so please hurry""

The seats are slightly better than other Low Cost Carriers. Business class seats are wider with wider armrest. Premium economy are slightly inferior,and economy seats are same as in other LCCs. Only thing is that they provide a headrest in the economy seats, that's all. The utterly ridiculous and nonsensical thing is that after airborne, the air hostesses pull curtains and SEGREGATE premium economy and business class from Economy. So firstly you can;t see anything in the front of the aisle. Secondly, nobody can go to the washroom. So if you are seating on the 16th/17th row, which is right in the middle of the plane, it means you have to walk all the way to the rear of the plane , just to pee !! Ridiculous !
I always do a web check in, for any flight that I take. Here, even when the flight was ready for web check in, I couldn't take any seat before row 16 !! The 1st 15 rows are business class and premium economy !! I always prefer and get seats in row 4 or 5 on Indigo. I air travel every month,and vouch that I will never get back on Vistara again. Utterly stupid of Vistara to do something like this.
On top of that,I could not get a seat of my liking,on the return flight,till 48 hours from the time,the flight actually took off. This never happens on other LCCs
I went to Mumbai in January,and was on Indigo. From my Kolkata home,I did web check in for both my onward and return flights,and took the printed boarding cards with me. While this time,in February 2017, while going to Delhi and coming back,I could take a print out of my onward flight,but the return flight kept on saying ""not yet ready for check in"" ! Disgusting and impractical. Finally as I was staying in a 5 star hotel in Delhi,and the hotel lobby had few MACS with a laser printer, I could get a print out of my return flight boarding card.

The food served on board in Vistara,is ridiculous and appalling to say the least. On my flight to Delhi,after being airborne, we were served a sour orange juice. Then after that, we were approached for food. Shamefully, there was no choice. All the LCCs have inflight magazines,and on that you can pinpoint your choices and then tell the stewards. Here the inflight magazine was devoid of any food options. Actually there was NO OPTION OF FOOD except Veg/Non veg - how appalling !! I asked for a Non veg food - and was served a bed of chickpea like stuff with two over-cooked samosas on them. Who on Earth has heard of this kind of rotten food ??? Are we paying for our food or not ?? Vistara, are you listening ? This is the last time, I am on Vistara, whatever people here say ! Give me options man, I am paying for it ! Absolutely nothing except this ridiculous dish and a cup of tea. That's it.

Same happened on my return flight (UK719 ) from Delhi, IGI Airport. The scheduled departure time was 20.10, but boarding started as late as 20.00 hrs. Later plane took off at about 20.20. Later same sour orange juice,no other option in economy. They didn't bother to tell anybody, when a kid in the front row,asked for apple juice,which was grudgingly served after some time. Since it was a late night flight (Kolkata arrival was 22.30 hrs ), they served dinner. Again a disgusting slob of green chicken with palang and some bits of jeera rice and a broth of rajma !! Terrible. Thank God I didn;t puke. The pudding served with it, as desser was bitter and tasted funny as well. Me and my colleague actually didn't eat and later had dinner at home

TATA Sons, no doubt all your businesses are going down the drain and all your business ventures are at a shocking loss making state. Sincerely hope, SIA ( Singapore Airlines ) understand their folly soon and end the joint venture with TATA Sons asap. This is horrible. Service is horrible.

I am done with Vistara. Will never be back. Check my accompanying pictures to see how unclean even the windows are. A splendid Sunset picture from the plane ,was marred because of dirty window glass"

Well as I entered the plane it looked different, they have a VIP class and another class that is between VIP and economy. They call this Premium Economy, this is with xtra leg space.
I was prepared for a boring 2+ hour flight and as usual had booked a exit seat. But my seat was snatched by a couple, they wanted to sit together, and I had to loose.
Then I realised that in Vistara the leg space on all the seats are good, so no need to book the exit seats for carrying your legs with you.
I was surprised when the crew started serving orange juice on arrival.
The food packaging is excellently done and food served is good, I had custard in the dessert. It was simply fantastic. Never had this yummy custard earlier.

Economy",Worst Experience,"Dear Team,
Please note it was the worst experience which I ever had in my life. It was my first & in fact last flight with Air Vistara. Please find the issue below which happened with me step wise:
1) Booked the flight from your official website considering that I was able to select my seat well in advance.
2) Flight was at 10:40 but got proponed to 10:15. Perfectly fine with me considering the weather condition in north India during this time.
3) Reached the airport at 8:20 (almost two hours prior to take off) & waited for 30 minutes in line for my turn because of rush at the airport.
4) At 8:50 reached the counter and showed my ID and ticket to Mr. Yashwant (or similar name) who was there to take my check-in & he allocated me a seat somewhere in the back row upon investigating with him I come to know that the seat which was booked by me has been allocated to someone else and when I asked why it has been allocated to someone else the reply which I got was totally unprofessional, he said sir we thought you will not be coming so that’s why your seat has been allocated to someone else??? Are you kidding me the ticket which was booked by me was on BNX basis then how can you allocate the seat to someone else, you should preferred it to be a No-show instead of allocating to someone else but then again he changed his statement and said no sir since you were late your seat has been given to someone.

How can you say that I was late when as per the policies you need to report 40 min prior to your departure for domestic flight??????

5) Now, comes the hilarious part he asked me to get side so that he can take other check-in. Fine understood considering the busy rush hours but for next 20 min there was no follow up for my ticket and the gentlemen was busy in doing his work and at 9:20 when I asked him what is the status he told me he is checking it and it was when I shouted on him and told him that I will put this on social media then a lady might be Supervisor (totally clueless of the situation) came and told me sorry sir your seat has been given to someone else considering we thought you will not be coming so that’s why your seat has been allocated to someone else???
Again the same lame excuse, who asked you guys to thought whether I will be travelling or not????
6) Now, after 10 minutes came Mr. Himanshu this gentleman gave me another stupid reason that sir it was a system error and that’s why your seat has been allocated to someone else common man how can this be happen. Also this guy was not having the information of what his colleague have already told me and then somehow they managed to get &A for which I agreed considering I was getting late as it was already 9:35 at the check-in counter.

There was no compensation offered to me by this gentlemen forget about the compensation he didn’t even apologies for the blunder which they had done. It was because of their lame excuses and lack of co-ordination in between the team members that it took almost 45 min to allocate a seat which was pre booked by me if you guys cannot honor a request please remove the option of selecting the seat from your side so that it will be more convenient to guest whether to go with Vistara or some other airline which are offering the same services in the same price.

Also what I observe during this 45 minute is that your Staff at T3 requires more training as they all look like a fresher and same is getting reflected at way they handle the customer.

Anyways thank you for giving me such a wonderful experience which I will not forget and will always think of it before booking a ticket with Vistara!!!!!!

Rahul Dalal"

I've had dairy creamer that was 6 months old, seats and seat pockets not cleaned from previous sector, rude check-in staff - and all this usually on Premium Economy - for which I don't think I am going to pay premium prices anymore.

Vistara may do well in the future, once they have more aircraft in their kitty, as of now they run fewer routes and schedules than their competition and their frequent flyer programme is difficult to figure out too."

Premium Economy",premium econ seat,"One way COK->DEL flight. Chose the airline primarily because of the price (7200 INR in total) and good departure time from COK (1835h), as compared to other airlines' offerings (many of them more expensive, and also departing early afternoon -- so for a leisure traveler hoping to make the most of available sunlight hours, taking the Vistara flight offered more hours of play time for a lower cost.) Took the premium economy class seat when it happened to be close to the price of a standard economy class seat, although it was the same seat width and food.

Onboard, the seats were comfortable enough. One noticeable thing was that it did not have AVOD, at all. For most domestic flights (1-2 hours) this should be fine. This being India, and COK to DEL in particular, the flight was 3.5 hours. I slept through all this time except to eat, but other travellers may have wished for some entertainment.

Food was excellent. Same food as economy, but in both cases the taste and portions were as good as international carriers. If memory serves, the premium economy seats had better seat pitch.

Would certainly consider taking this airline and class of cabin again, though wondering whether it offers code-share with foreign-operated international airlines. Did not notice other flight numbers which may have indicated that the flight was code-shared."

Premium Economy",Wonderful Experience,This is an excellent airline. I have flown it several times. I just want to recount the experience in premier Economy. Normally if you have booked economy you can request upgrade by two ways. a) Standby for Rs 1500 for Del-Mumbai or confirmed for about Rs 3000/--On one ocassion i have got upgrade on standby but was not lucky in 2nd time. However whenever you book on Vistara go to their website and on two ocassions i found that the Premier Economy fare LOWER than economy and i quickly booked. Done that twice with success. The experience in Premier Economy is really great. Much better meals and leg space. Must try. highly recommended.

I have done premium and economy both and I can confidently say that their services are class apart. Their food is not only edible buy delicious unlike most of the airlines. The crafts are new and you can feel the difference in the leg space. Wish they would expand their routes quickly."

Economy",Truly world-class service for Indian domestic flyers,"When the airline was first announced over 2 years back, I had hoped for some refreshing change compared to how the existing airlines were 'flying' their passengers. With Tata and Singapore airlines joining hands, I sincerely hoped for an experience that would remind us that we were more than just a 'seat' or a 'pax on the list'. And the change has been far more than refreshing. Even before I took my first experience, I booked tickets for my wife and my 8 month old son, knowing well that they are going to be in the best hands. I just couldn't hold myself back, and booked myself a return ticket (B'lore - Delhi - B'lore) and my first leg was on Diwali night. The memory of that journey is going to last forever with me. Thereafter, it was only Vistara and Vistara always! I make sure that I fly Vistara even when I'm flying for business."
