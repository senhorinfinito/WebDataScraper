Gaurav126in wrote a review Dec 2019,30,New Delhi - Singapore,Southeast Asia,Economy,"Vistara International operations are a mess, domestic is great....","This was a surprise as domestic Vistara flights have been the best but International experience was a complete mess.
First, the check-in, the staff was either ill-trained or had no idea on certain things and took almost 45 minutes to clear 6-7 passengers. Could be a bad day. Next, the business class that I was about to upgrade was a sheer surprise as I dont expect it to be just more spacious seats on a 6 hour flight. Felt happy that I didn't spend money on it.
The next one was a bumper, a 6 hour flight entails one meal that also is ridiculously less in quantity that a normal person can't feel fulfilled. I have traveled throughout the world and frankly Qatar, emirates or BA does a better job even on shorter flights of about 3.5 to 4 hours, leave aside the longer ones. The entertainment system (wifi based) is so limited in options that you would rather look out of the window only. When Vistara has to compete with all the International airlines, these things have to be better if not the best, at-least. While coming back, they ran out of veg options. Someone's jain food was given to someone else. LOL. All in all, I would say, Internationally, Vistara has a lot of ground to cover. Domestic, it is the best."

Arshad H wrote a review Dec 2019,10,New Delhi - Mumbai,Domestic,Premium Economy,VISTARA ~A NEW FEELING,"Flying Vistara has given me a new feeling. The suave, svelte, satisfying service is quickly hitting the turbulence of becoming bigger. The real complaint is outside the Airbus 320 and its hostesses who remain as they were...charming and attentive.
The turbulence is of size. Hastily recruited ground staff, loaders for luggage who are taught nothing both loading and unloading, minimalist training to handle delays, and politeness which are euphemistically told are due to operational “congestion” and worst, on a significantly delayed flight from DELHI, usually, the PRIORITY luggage, like mine was “last bag on bay”. Thrice.
No wonder another passenger on a different sector has given a 1 star. Another 2 star. In December.
All airlines the world over take off with aplomb. It is when the foggines of the ground staff appears that the level of service starts descending. Which is where good management keeps the flyer happy and secure. Lot of praise has sprung up for SpiceJet and GoAir recently...ask yourself ’why’ Vistara."
xavpinon wrote a review Dec 2019,10,New Delhi - Bagdogra,Domestic,Economy,Flying (or trying to fly) Vistara has been a nightmare,"Flying Vistara (or trying to fly Vistara) has been a nightmare.

We arrived 1 hour 30 minutes before this domestic flight. A first check-in counter sent us to a second check-in counter where we queued again, which sent us to a third check-in counter where we queued again, which sent us back to the second checkin counter. There seemed to be a problem but everyone looked a bit embarrassed to tell us. Finally, we were told that the checkin time had been exceeded !

We were directed toward a ""manager"", some kind of apparatchik chatting with a colleague in the middle of the terminal. He looked annoyed when we came to talk to him and quickly got rid of us by finding us a powerless assistant to talk to.

We finally learnt that we had been overbooked, which is surprising as we arrived pretty early. The assistant told us ""good news ! you'll get a full refund !"" whereas it was obvious that we were not going to pay for a service we did not get. We suspect they overbooked foreign passengers rather than Indians. Apparently, it happens everyday and it was no surprise for the staff.

Vistara made things worse by refusing to buy another companies tickets because they were too expansive. We finally bought a new ticket at our own expense and wasted a full day of holiday.

For a person of good built and stature its torturous to sit through it. Also the guy sitting in front had a tough time as he was travelling with an infant and he had no place to even open his pantry tray as there no space with the infant in the arms. All the flight procedures were rushed through so they could start the food and beverage service asap. For such a short distance flight it is a nightmare for the flight attendants to serve everyone and then collect the trays back on time. With a lot of time wasted on serving individual glasses of water to every passenger I could actually feel the agony of the attendant. They also ran out non-veg meal much to peoples dismay as they had to settle for veg. Food was ok nothing much to write about. Hope they work on the flight quality and service further.

Took the 5:50 pm flight from Lko to Del.

Flight late by an hour and announced that only 35 mins late.

Usual reason of congestion from Delhi given. Surprisingly all other flights like Indigo, spice etc didn't seem to get caught in the air traffic congestion.

Seats too seem to have been adjusted recently since I seem to find lesser space between the seats.

Snacks were only veg sandwiches! Maybe then Air India is a better option!!!

Air stewardess had to serve water in glasses to all passengers. Why not water bottles atleast for the short duration flights. Air stewards can barely manage to serve all passengers before the landing announcement is made.

Quality of the cole slaw sandwich needs improvement.

Boarding at Lko airport is always chaotic. Why have the 3 different lines when the seat / zone wise boarding will not be followed ??

Overall someone from management needs to travel on this flight to understand the travellers plight"

The primary reason being the choices of menu catered in this route. First of all, which airlines on earth serves Lunch in place of breakfast. When I asked about it, the explanations given by one of the crew was - we got a feedback from passengers that the breakfast served was insufficient, therefore they shifted to Linch ( not that the lunch was great though). With a little bit of persuasion I have to opt for a little later when needed services category placing a demand for coffee only for the time being was met with a high resistance. Normally Vistara crew are all smiles and extremely good at handling passengers. ( At least my experience of dealing with them being a platinum class flier in Indian Skies) but somewhat the crew in the flight weren’t warm.

While the staff member concerned made us wait for about 10 minutes and we expected that he will arrange for ramp to ramp transfer or at least a buggy to go to gate through security ( about 20 minutes walk).He did neither and made no efforts to request to expedite security check with long queues and wasted our time instead. We had to make our own efforts to request passengers to jump the queue and also get a buggy. Eventually we could barely make it to the gate and to our surprise found the counter staff with intimation on the late arrival of the flight, as if her counterpart in the ground staff had not kept her in the loop .
Even the cabin crew in the flight was quite lackadaisical in serving refreshments and showed no sense of urgency in a short duration flight to serve the snacks .

I had initially booked on economy class and purchased a confirmed upgrade since I had injured my foot. To my surprise the amount was debited from my account and there was no response from either vistara or option town regarding my payment. I called several times and the customer care executives put me on hold for 20 - 30 minutes each. After having a harrowing experience with 4 of them doing the same thing, I finally got through to one of them who registered my complaint and assured me of priority redressal since I had injured my foot.

Until the date of travel I did not revise any call back. I called again to the customer care number and was informed that there were no seats available and ""if i wanted the money would be refunded"". This statement was made by the manager of optiontown Mr. Joe.Vistara executives also repeated the same thing.

I received my refund but it is strange that They said no seat available when I paid for confirmed upgrade and not stand by. ultimately I had to fly in economy with a broken foot despite taking precaution from my side to purchase confirmed upgrade.

The customer care executives are terrible. Considering the same I wrote complaints to custrelations@airvistara.com and other than getting an automated response that they will get back in 72 hours I have not heard anything from them. It has been three weeks now and there has been no response from Vistara about my email complaints. Customer care with air vistara is the worst experience you can have.

Manish21 wrote a review Nov 2019,10,Kolkata - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Worst & Horrible Airline.,This is truly a worst experience till now in my life and they don't know how to take care of their customers. Customer handling is very poor and don't know the basics of handling customer. My flight was cancelled by the airline and when I called them to provide me alternate flight to my destination. They simply asked me pay the difference amount. THIS IS CALLED ROBBERY. If customers are at fault they don't understand the situation of a customer and never try to listen to them then how can they ask me to pay the difference when I was not at fault. On top of that they kept on telling lie to me that there is no flight to next day. I prove them wrong because they 03 regular flights and put additional flight too but they kept on saying that I will have to make the difference amount. I felt very cheated about their SO CALLED CORPORATE TOUGH ATTITUDE. I would recommend every one please be careful before opting for this airline.

mostlyharmless wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Singapore - New Delhi,Asia,Economy,made 5 hours in a B737 tolerable...,"Morning flight SIN-DEL. Check-in was at Terminal 3, however, we were transferred by bus to aircraft (which was parked in bay between T2 and T4). This necessitated a long bus transfer, which is awkward for those with lots of hand luggage. Aircraft was B737-800 (transferred from Jet Airways) in 2 class configuration. Friendly crew on boarding. Seats were standard economy, fitted out in purple and grey. No data on seat pitch, but felt like 30"" or 31"", which means adequate but not generous. No in seat USB power or IFE, although this could be streamed to personal devices via wifi. The saving grace was the flight was probably only 30% full, likely due to this being a new service, so there were many seats empty which gave the impression of much more room. A warm towel service was given before takeoff, together with a menu card (in economy!). Meal service commenced pretty quickly after takeoff, with complimentary wine available also. An unexpected delight was ice-cream for dessert. Just prior to arrival, a short drinks service was carried out. Crew were generally pleasant throughout, only slight grudge was the insistence that iPad's couldn't be used on landing. We arrived on time, and again, no aerobridge service but were transferred by bus into DEL airport. Overall, good inflight service, reasonable food (with ice-cream!), but I would be a bit hesitant to travel on a 5 hour flight on a B737 narrow-body if the flight was full. The seats also were a little spartan, lacking niceties like USB. However, I read that the SIN-DEL service may be transferred to the newer A320 neo, which may give a slightly better experience."

SChopra wrote a review Oct 2019,10,New Delhi - Goa,Domestic,Premium Economy,Where did Vistara lose my bag?,"I and my husband flew from Delhi to Goa on October 23 (UK 847), and one of our checked bags was not delivered to us, and the status of the bag is still not available after 9 days. We have repeatedly followed up with the Vistara staff, but Air Vistara does not seem to be taking this up very seriously.

When we had initially requested for video footage to be reviewed on the day of the incident, we were lied to by Air Vistara who said that one of their staff has seen the video but it was hazy and hence the bags on the belt were not clearly visible. On repeated follow-ups all we were told is that there is no update. When we returned to Goa airport on Oct 27 for our return flight to Delhi we took up the matter strongly with Air Vistara staff and the following facts were established:

1. No Air Vistara staff had viewed the video footage- just that the security staff told them that the video is not clear so they clearly had lied to us.
2. No formal request was made to review the video footage by Air Vistara - the security staff said that permission was required from the Airport Director and none have been sought so far

We agreed with the Air Vistara staff that they would take the following steps:

1. Formal request to be made to airport director to view the video footage
2. If above efforts were not successful a police report would be filed
3. If video footage or other information revealed that the bag was misplaced in Delhi then a formal report to airport security and a police report would be filed in Delhi.

Subsequently we received an update that Air Vistara staff finally saw the video footage - which now was stated to be quite clear ! - and the bag was never on the baggage belt. They also said they have informed their Delhi office about the same. We asked for a copy of the communication but have not been provided with the same.

Air Vistara is responsible for our delivering our bag back to us; if it has disappeared from a secure environment like an airport we expect that they will file formal reports with airport security and the police in order to satisfactorily discharge their responsibilities. This only leaves us wondering how safe are our checked in bags with the airline if they are not yet able to trace the whereabouts of the bag.

Overall we are very unhappy with the customer care - no sensitivity or sense of urgency is exhibited or serious efforts made, considering that a customer’s festival holiday has been spoiled.

We have to return to Thailand on Sunday (on Air Vistara) and still don’t know what to do - buy a new bag? Check in a new bag and new clothes and toiletries and risk the bag not arriving?"

Ashok M wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Bangkok - New Delhi,Asia,Economy,Boozy passenger in the next seat,"I thought I had made the right choice by choosing seat 7B and would get some time to spread my legs. The pilot announced boarding over and I shifted to the vacant seat 7A. But just as the aerobridge was being detached in rushes a young man with an open can of Singha beer in one hand and a cell phone in the other. He tried to change to the aisle seat (reason became clear later) but refused te exhange with my middle seat. He was cursing into his cell phone in rustic Punjabi planning his liquour purcahes at the Delhi duty free on landing. No sooner had the captain switched off the seat belt sign, he jumped over us and literally ran the whole aisle to the rear toilets shouting 'hato hato ' - as if his bladder would burst, if delayed. Seeing his condition, 7C shifted to 7A to allow him disturbance free access to the toilet.
Relieved, he dosed off and missed the snacks tray when the young hostess came around. On getting up he realised he had missed out on the free drinks and started badgering the hostess ( almost in tears) for endless rounds of Red Label, soda and even 'moongphali'. Two airhostesses plied him with five drinks ( this is at 4pm) after which he again slumped into his seat.
Come Delhi, his cell phone again came to life and he again let off a string of Punjabi 'gaalis' - this time his arrangements for buying duty free booze had fallen flat as his financier had already pushed off from the airport !
Hats off to the young Vistara hostess who did her duty under trying circumstances !"

I was travelling Business class between Bangalore and Mumbai one Monday evening recently.

Things didn't get off to a great start as we were told that our flight would be 20 minutes delayed. In the end we took off 55 minutes late. The seasoned travellers on this route sagely informed me that this was often the case as Mumbai only really has one runway.

Anyway boarding was trouble free and I found myself in a comfortable business class seat. The plane was a Boeing 737-800. Service was extremely polite and professional. Non alcoholic drinks were offered before take off and, once air borne a light meal was available. That comprised a tiny pot of Russian salad, a fish curry and piece of cake.

The rest of the flight was trouble free. We seemed to circle over Mumbai forever but eventually landed around 11 in the evening.

Rashmi Rao wrote a review Oct 2019,10,Singapore - New Delhi,Asia,Economy,Pathetic service on ground in Del,"We took flight 116 from Sg to Del on 11th oct ‘19. On Reaching Delhi we found that not only our Tas luggage locks were missing from both our bags, the zip on one bag was broken and our bags had been opened also. On complaining to the staff we were told this is normal wear and tear. I still don’t understand how two bags with missing locks and broken zip can be normal wear and tear!! Normal wear and tear on a five hour flight ???? I don’t understand this.
On top of that the staff is telling us this happens all the time and we should not get so either up. Another reason given by the staff was that the customs must have broken the locks as they must have found something suspicious in our bags during X-ray ..The most pathetic and irresponsible answers an airline could give to its passengers..on the bags being opened the staff had no explanation to give except they kept on blaming customs. When we argued with them on how their explanation is totally irrelevant to what had happened, the junior staff got one senior staff who was only busy on his ph. This senior staff had the audacity to offer us Rs 600 for all the inconvenience caused to us. The cost of one Tas lock is more than Rs 600. We just refused this petty amount and left the airport as we had already wasted one hour on this. For sure I am not going to recommend Vistara to anyone EVER.
I am not at all active on social media but thanks to Vistara first time I am leaving a review on trip advisor. I am going to leave as many reviews on as many social sites as I can. I am totally motivated to ensure people are careful when they take such airlines. I am disappointed and angry with the treatment meted out to me.

It’s called robbery, stealing and looting money from people.

My check in bag was tampered with and the security lock was removed after I checked in the baggage at Amritsar Airport and I received it with a broken security lock at Delhi airport.
Eleven thousand rupees cash is missing from my check in baggage.
Kindly take urgent action and restore the loss.
Baggage tag number: 0228UK336728
Flight number : UK707
FIR for property stolen has been lodged in the Police Station IGI AIRPORT, District IGI UNIT on 04/10/2019.
No positive response from Vistara or Delhi Police.
It is a shame that most secure zones of the nation are giving refuge to Robbers and Criminals.

I have been shuttling DEL-BLR-DEL due to work. Overall I like the services offered by Vistara. I would say the inflight experience depends on the cabin attendants who serve you during the flight. There were a couple of trips where I felt the service was average; however, in most of the flights, I experienced outstanding service.

Special Mention:
In the flight I took from Bangalore to Delhi, a Cabin attended named Pema served me and her care for passengers was outstanding.

Check-in at Airport:
Smooth as always. The ground staff are experienced to handle passenger queries.

Seats:
Seats were quite lovely, and there was sufficient leg space.

Meals:
Just one word - Delicious.
Vistara serves hot meals during the flight. There were options for vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Hot and cold drinks were also available. I had lassi, and it was perfect. Vistara also serves Starbucks coffee in the flight.

Take-off and Landing:
Very good. The touchdown was smooth.

Baggage Collection at Airport:
At times, I have seen priority baggage arriving late at the belts.

Overall:
Good experience and professional services offered by Vistara."

Prowander wrote a review Sep 2019,10,New Delhi - Amritsar,Domestic,Premium Economy,Terrible service - once again,"Today, 20 September, was another example of Vistara's terrible service.  

We purchased round-trip tickets from Delhi to Amritsar.   We purchased Premium Economy to Amritsar and Business on the return flight to Delhi.

After we purchased the round-trip tickets, we found out there is no Vistara lounge in Amritsar.  We are clearly getting cheated out of the full benefits of the business class tickets.   

When we checked in for the first leg of the trip in Premium Economy, the flight from Delhi to Amritsar was delayed by one hour.  Since we knew Vistara was cheating us out of lounge access on the return flight, we ask if it was possible to get access on the current outbound  flight.  This question completely confused the agent who was checking us in.  She eventually called her duty manager by the name of Quamar.  Ms. Quamar was basically useless.  She claimed to understand the situation perfectly but said there was nothing she could do to make the situation fair.  Simple compensation in the form of complementary lounge access in Delhi was completely out of the possible options.  Ms. Quamar, the duty manager, was totally useless in resolving a very simple problem    

It's employees like Ms. Quamar who reinforce the reason I don't fly Vistara on a regular basis.

Vistara's Moto of ""fly the new feeling"" is meaningless when they have employees like Ms. Quamar who know nothing about customer service.

Instead we used our Priority Pass and went to Plaza Premium Lounge in the Delhi airport, which is definitely superior to Vistara's pop-up lounge in Delhi airport.  We know, we've been to Vistara's lounge on a prior trip."

Waste of time and money. I would like to specially mention this guy Amitav Rawat who is apparently on some senior position he doesn’t deserve.

He was rude and was getting pleasures by troubling passengers.
We were asked to offload the flight as we reached late at the boarding gate by 1 minute. He kept on arguing for the next 15 mins instead of getting us on the flight. This was all thanks the Vistara Staff who were of no help and didn’t provide us any intimation. The delhi T3 airport was superly crowded which led to delay in security and we happened to reach 1 minute late.

And the worst of all Vistara being super non considerate of it.

Food quality was good !! Choice of cusine was not that great !!
Crew needs to improve !! Just becoz fellow passengers wre behaving weird they forgot good service dont blame them for the way they spoke to some irritating passengers but over looked our needs!! Busy catering to the passengers bugging them repeatedly.
No inflight entertainment as such. Connect with wifi of the airlines and stream the entertainment only if you have their app installed.
Fine with that but then atleast have a usb port to keep your phone pr device charged for watching a movie.
The cabin needs to be upgraded with either usb ports or a personal screen entertainment for a flight more than 3 hrs.
Overall experience as compared to a domestic flight pf vistara would be a mere 3 out of 10.
Alot of improvement is required.
So fellows please wait for the baby to mature before thinking of travelling internationally on this airline."

Although not the fault of the airline, the aircraft was old and very poorly maintained. The headrest on my seat was broken on one side and the seat, once reclined, did not return to its original position unless pulled up. I noticed the tray table of the seat in front was broken and had a strap around it to hold it into place. The light in the toilet was not working when the door closed and, as you can imagine, halfway into the flight, the toilet was very much not clean. The air crew didn’t seem to be cleaning the bathrooms. After finally getting to sleep in the tiny, cramped seat, I was awoken aggressively by the stewardess halfway through the red-eye flight for the meal, which I declined. I was then asked to put my seat back upright, so at about 2am Mumbai time, 4.30am Singapore time, I was upright in my broken seat contemplating my folly in flying Vistara.

and transit onward to Pune by Vistara was fraught with anxiety but Vistara was on hand.
Right from greeting us at the bridge (Mr Anil) we were whisked throught immigration and customs thanks to him. The clock was ticking but we made it just in time to catch our flight.
The inflight service was excellent and comfortable. The experience could have soured owing to a missing baggage but Vistara made it good at the baggage claim and true to their assurance the item was delivered at our home the very next day,
Way to go Vistara!"

This really old couple was called for baggage drop. The ground staff member Bimal greeted then with the warmest smile & with so much respect & regard. All the tiredness on the face of the old couple while waiting in the queue just washed away & they were gleaming with a smile.

To my pleasant surprise , I was greeted by Bimal only & he was warm & extremely hospitable.

It is people like him that make Vistara experience a pleasure even before you fly :-)"

siriprs wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Hyderabad - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Not a very good first time experience,"After reading all good reviews about Vistara, I was excited to look for my first flight on Vistara and that too a full-service flight on a Domestic route. Being a Singapore airlines subsidiary, I had high expectations.

Seats can be selected with no additional cost which is good.

Very very disappointed because of 2.5hrs delay. How can you delay that much when you are running only two flights per day between cities whereas IndiGo can run 10 flights and still be on time ?

Cabin service was horrible too. They served meals, which was tasty. But they don't serve water with it. So, if you choke while eating it, tough luck. People had to repeatedly ask them for water while eating. What the heck ? Who trained cabin crew on how to serve meals ? How long does it take to pour water in the cup along with serving meal tray ? But they would prefer serving coffee and tea after meal than water during the meal.

Coke is not free with meal. You have to pay extra for it.

Overall, my first time experience is horrible with Vistara. Will stick to Indigo as much as possible."

This is probably to combat the pricing of carriers like spice and indigo but this option for Vistara is still a bit higher priced compared to them. The space in the flight continues to be good and customer service was good as usual. The aerobridge was not used for this flight and apart from these small quibbles which are probably cost cutting initiatives, the airline remains one of the better experiences."

I was a very dominant traveler until Jet airways was operating and always avoided traveling with competition airlines.
However due to lack of options now when I booked the air ticket and Travelled in Vistara flight it was a very decent experience I had comparatively.
The crew member was well groomed, flight housekeeping was also satisfactory.

The boarding time was bit high as currently am at base level of membership.

The only thing am concerned with was the flight landing experience😶.
Since I can't consider the same as safe landing.
When I was be-boarding, I specifically asked the Airhostess about the Captain & Co-Captains name since that was the Worst landing exp I had in a decade. At that day the weather conditions seems to be ok.
Rest everything was good Regards to Vistara."
moogul818 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,New Delhi - Pune,Domestic,Economy,Best in Class,The check in and boarding was smooth. The take off was on time. Vistara must be one of the few airlines which is defined by its cabin service and crew.They make you feel welcome.It is a sight to see the cabin crew make efforts to assist passengers while boarding and stowing their baggage. The service was courteous and efficient. As a full service airline you will mostly find it priced a little higher than other airlines in the same sector. It is worth your money.
pmmathur wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Hyderabad - New Delhi,Domestic,Economy,Improve please.,"We, family of nine reached Hyderabad from Thirupati by another airline around 7pm.
Our Vistara flight to Delhi was STD around 8.15pm.
On reaching the Vistara Gate 24 which is on the food court level we waited for boarding.
There was no announcements nor any update on the TV Screens. The small boarding screen was displaying the number of some international airlines (later we learnt that this Vistara flight was Code Sharing flight). We waited and waited confused and tired. No communication regarding status of our flight.
There was total chaos at the gate when the boarding commenced. Our seats were in rows 27,28 but as there was no order and people were rushing like for a city bus we fell behind. This caused lot of grief when we got into the plane and reached our seats almost at the rear. The racks were full by then.
Not like reputation of Vistara, the inside service was hopeless. It was further worsened by suspending it due to frequent turbulence.
And worst came when the aircraft docked around mid night at almost end of T3 ( I think that was gate 58 or so) with no golf carts to ferry passengers (old and children) upto the escalators leading to exit.
Very poor show by Vistara."

I flew Vistara for the first time as Vistara came to Chennai only this year.in February. Mumbai is now on their radar from Chennai which I was very eagerly awaiting. I also await, Pune, Hyderabad and Kolkata even if these were hopping flights. Vistara is the best thing that has happened to discerning travellers after the closure of Jet Airways.

So I decided to travel to Kolkata from Mumbai with this great airline. The best thing that I had liked about the airline, for which I had praised it last time was that it had an option of purchasing 'Priority Check-in' for Rs 400, which I had lauded as an innovative idea to help the senior citizens like me. Unfortunately, this time it was not available. Last time 2 meals were served in the economy class, free of charge for the 2 sectors from Amritsar to Delhi and Delhi to Kolkata. This time there was nothing.
I had this rustic couple sitting next to me, the man chewing away betel nut and chuna and making odd noises which were disturbing. It is mentioned by the airline that chewing betel nut is not allowed on the flight, flight attendants did not notice. After some time they took out their Paraths and strong smelly Achar and had their nasta. The flight attendants did not notice. While taking off the guy in the seat in front of me was reclined backwards. I had to point it out to a flight attendant. What I noticed the cabin crew were not attentive towards the passengers.
The whole journey was a disaster for me. The respect I had for this airline has fallen a few notches for me"
