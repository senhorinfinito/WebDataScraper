Premium Economy",Good Experience,"Overall it was really a great experience, first and foremost nice ambiance inside aircraft, second good leg space which gives more pleasant experience for people like me who are 6ft +, it was late night flight but very well managed, polite staff, only sad part was food.. it was poor, reason may be anything... so zero on food part and 100 for other overall Vistara experience,"

Economy","No international card, and no courtesy regarding baggage issues","This is the first time I chose Vistara, being an NRI we used my international card to purchase two way tickets on July 15 for my travel on 21 December 2017. On Sept 17 I believe all information regarding the card as requested by your team was sent. I got all alerts regarding flight changes on my phone. I also got sms regarding checkin online, however that didnt work, and when i called the customer service they said it was coz of the international card. Inspite of all this when we reached the airport, we had to wait for 20 minutes to get the boarding pass. When we got in the plane we were assigned the last available seats which we could not recline back hence an uncomfortable for me.

On our return journey, once again we could not do the online check in, once again we waited another 20 minutes for the same international card to be verified, again we got the last seats available, which could not be reclined. To top it all, there was a bag which was held due to a battery in it, we were strolling in the airport for 2 hours during which they could have called us to inform about the stranded bag, and finally when we were about to board they tell us about the bag and that the bag cannot be sent in the same flight. we had to travel back to the airport the next day spending 7 hrs on the road two way to get the bag. I am so disappointed when I know the airport could have called to inform about the bag and they didnâ€™t, and could have given a better service to an international customer. So tourist coming from abroad please avoid this flight. especially if you are using an international card."

Premium Economy",A Excellent Treat,"My first flight on Vistara and what an absolute delight it was. Check in was smooth - the flight was delayed due to the plane coming in being late but regular announcements was made.

On boarding, beep-beep on the scanning and dear, sir, you've been upgraded to premium economy with my partner. Wow, the seats was nice and the service excellent. The presentation of food was good with real cutlery. My only regret was that it was such a short flight.

Vistara is a joint operation between the mighty Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines and the quality shows.

Will try to fly with them more often."

Economy",Rescheduled domestic flight by 7 hours,"I booked a domestic return flight for my mother from Lucknow to Delhi with vistara but now they have rescheduled her journey by 7 hours which means it will impact her onward journey to London.
I tried contacting them several times but that was a mission as they seem to be do busy that I was on the call for 2 hours.
I booked my ticket via makemytrip.com website who was again very difficult to get through. On top of that the staff wasn't very helpful as they couldn't understand the issue and asked me to call directly to vistara."

Economy",The topmost literally,"My maiden voyage on Vistara after becoming a silver member. WOW. It was my belief that another private airline was the best in premium travelling until I had the chance of flying the Vistara. All services are immaculate and customer friendly, starting from the check-in to receiving luggage at the destination airport. Special thanks to Shivani (crew member in -flight) who was serving with a smile.
Vistara is truly a relief to fly, maybe because it takes you back to those days of flying when air travel was considered a luxury and the customers were pampered. Though, no pampering happens but the class of service and friendliness of the staff is worth mention. I was served oriental vegetarian meal and the same was excellent.
Thank you VISTARA."

Premium Economy",True hospitality from TATA,"The legacy of TATA for true and perfect hospitality is continue in their aviation project called Vistara Airlines. It is a true winner in customer service, inflight services, check in services, neat and clean aircraft, tasty fresh food served decently by friendly warm crew. Vistara going to be a big challenge to Jet Airways in future. Looking forward to fly more domestic and also internationally once started.
All the best"
