Domestic
Economy",Good Flight,"I flew from Vistara for the first time & liked the experience.
The luggage handling, boarding & de- boarding, in-flight crew, seating & food all were good. The seating had a decent space. The crew was courteous & helpful.
The flight was a little delayed due to bad weather but it was very nicely handled by the ground crew.
The only thing not so great was the staff at check-in counter. They looked a bit in panic mode. For example, one of the staff was putting a tag on my check-in luggage while I was waiting in the line & a counter just become available. The staff directing the customers to counters came to me & said in a tone to go the counter like I was boarding the plane late. It just took half an minute more with my luggage & I was standing at the counter. I didn't understand the panic there. The airline should take notice as this is the first time a customer interacts with the airline & if the staff here is not that great, the starting experience goes for a toss & it may affect the overall experience.
Overall, a very good experience."

However, to me the airlines did not impress much, mainly because I had already heard a lot about it and was expecting much more than that. But everything was good - the aircraft was new, the staff very friendly, food items were excellent. The ground duty staff was also very helpful. Overall, the airlines can be said to be above other airlines run by private companies. There was no announcement by pilot about the height at which flying and over which city flying. Incidentally, I heard them announcing the word ""customers"" for ""passengers"" which is used in all other airlines."

There is ""service"" and then there is ""service from the heart"" and Nidun immediately made us feel the latter.

I found it just like any other airlines so the fare is not justified. May be they are charging for Brand.

May be they charge extra for meal served on flight I was disappointed.

I travelled on 10 Dec and then 19 Dec. However even after nine days, their menu was same chickpeas and bread (kulcha) which was soaked with chhole so got soggy. Though packaging was good, this aspect has to be looked into

I wonder if this standard menu served on all flights on all days. If so, this would be pity for Tata group which is known in Hospitality and should not be difficult to come up with hundreds of options and variety for in-flight catering."

At first, orange juice or coca cola were given Only the problem was that there was no choice of meal selection. Either you select Veg which consisted of 4 Parathas, Potato Sabzi, one Bun Roti, and one Aam Dahi or Non Veg which consisted off 4 Parathas, Egg Bhuji Sabzi, one Bun Toti and one Aam Dahi and both of the meal boxes had spoon, fork, knife, handkerchief, dairy whitener, sugar.

Lovely choice of colour - aubergine matches their stated ambition of being India's premium airline. Beats Jet Airways hands down on service, food and on-time performance. I have flown Vistara a few times now and it's been on-time or whereabouts every single time.

Also, they just relaunched their frequent flier programme - Club Vistara. Felt shortchanged though by some benefits which could not be applied retrospectively to old Club Vistara members, but otherwise waiting to see how this FFP turns out. They have limited tie-ups at the moment. That said, it's just been 2 years so kudos to it anyway.

Economy","Good Food, Bad Legroom","This was my first flight with Vistara. While booking ticket - I opted for seat 7A - thinking, it will be just after the premier class - hence I will get the first row in economy & hence a bit space for stretching. But the saga started when I reached Kempegowda Airport.

(1) Firstly, though I had done web check-in, I didn't manage a printout. So, was searching for Kiosk Print. But none of the kiosk had Vistara option for Kiosk print.
(2) So, was searching for the Vistara counter - which was not available at that time (well, I had reached a tad ahead of time)
(3) After the wait - had a smooth check-in (i.e. got the boarding pass). Staff at counter was very friendly/cordial
(4) Boarding process was well maintained & pretty smooth
(5) But as I entered the flight, I realized there were 3 segments in the flight i.e. Business, Premium Economy & then Economy & no physical division per se.They were separate by curtains.

My observations:
- Business & Premium Economy were nice - as expected. With enough legroom.
- But as the economy started, they did appear claustrophobic.
- Service by on-board crew was fine
- Food served was good in quality (but perhaps they could have saved on the exterior decoration & invested that on bringing up the portion size)
- Food tray - was too narrow to maneuver

Conclusion:
- Since I got a good price/deal - I managed. But the journey was difficult.
- So, if you prefer a bit of space, go for Premium or Premium Economy
- Do I recommend this? Hmnn...I am still not decided!"

A few pointers:
- I had requested for a child meal but apparently they didnt have any - then why have that option on the site? The regular meal was too spicy for my 6yr old and they did not have any other options which I could offer my child - very disappointing.
- My child had a bad ear ache on descend, I requested for a bottle of water to help her and I was told ""I will be right back"" - that right back never happened.

Easy and hassle free boarding, de-boarding. Food quality was best. didnt expect the food to be this good from an local airline. Food was warm and not soggy as experienced in other airlines. Flight was punctual and on time."

Meals are included in the flight and that's a plus. Not only that, meals have a variation and it surely does makes a better traveling experience.

From checking in to boarding the flight, never faced any hassle. So far, the travel has been on schedule. The flight attendants are warm and friendly. Seats are comfortable and there is enough leg room. Even after a long travel journey, flying on Vistara keeps you fresh !!"

Extremely polite, smiling, courteous,and service oriented,thanks to TATA and SQ training. Unlike other domestic airline staff,where they just push their motions be on ground or air,here air vistara excells by their warmth and service from their desire to be a no. 1 and strives so.
They should keep it up. All the best wishes."

The attendants were very good but definitely need tobe trained more - as we compare to the other airline attendants. The flight commander was talking on public system - could not understand a bit - more of a ritual stuff. The flight duration is very long - 2.5 hrs. The seats are not reclinable - very uncomfortable - my neck started paining - ultimately I have to stand up and do some exercises to relieve the pain. Seats are very bad compared to other airlines - should be reclinable atleast for long duration flights.
The departure and arrival time punctuality was good."

To my surprise, Vistara reschedules my flight due to which I will be missing my business meeting and a lunch in a 5 star. What crap service is this.

They are offering a full refund or to take any of their other flights. I don't need both of them because right now, I am scheduled to fly this week and the prices have already increased for all the airlines. There is almost double price of flights now.

Too disappointed!"

This once, there was an agonizing delay for over 30 minutes while we had to wait in the aircraft before it took off, reason given was ATC has asked them to pushback due to air traffic congestion in Delhi. On top of that , there was a very unruly, high-spirited group of 4 young working professionals, treating the aircraft as it was there own private lounge, shouting out loudly, making jokes and creating a shindy. I wonder why the stewardesses did not ask them to pipe down.left me with a terrible headache."

Premium Economy",Wonderful experience,"Just the 2nd time in last one year that i am flying Vistara. I do have to say that it has been a wonderful experience. Flt Uk 988 on October 17I chose standbay premier economy which got confirmed a day before the flight. The seats are very comfortable with decent leg room I found the inflight service very efficient. the meals were better than a standard economy.I really enjoyed the experience.

I also wanted to enrol for the Vistara-Axis bank Loyalty card and applied. However the terms are not great at all. I wanted to get on to the Gold membership as advertised in the inflight magazine. The terms are not comparable with other tagged programs such as Amex-Jetairways platinum. i was left wondering why on earth anyone will apply for the top end Vistara card.If you are serious to get members Axis bank and Vistara has to come out with a better deal of lower membership fee @ Rs 10,000. That can encourage me to travel more on the airline as i fly at least 25 times an year domestic"

My mom was a strict vegetarian (no onion and garlic) and it's very difficult to arrange food for her outside my home. I was surprised when the announcement came that they would serve free meal during the flight. I ordered non-veg and reluctantly ordered Veg meal for mom assuming it would be of onion and garlic. But i was shocked to find that mon was eating the meal. I asked her when did you started taking onion. Mom smiled and said that it was pure veg meal. I was relaxed and it gives me immense Joy looking at her enjoying the meal. Thanks Vistara!...

Domestic
Economy",Best domestic airline in India and Amazing Lounge at IGI Airport,"As I arrived to Delhi Airport from New York via Emirates, I had a 5-6 hour layover to kill before my flight with my family to Goa. We purchased an entrance to the Vistara lounge at IGI Airport which was cheaper than staying in a nap lounge or the holiday inn inside the airport. It was well worth it, very nice lounge chairs and amazing staff/service. The food was amazing as well ( I ate as much as I could). This truly felt like a Taj Hotel experience (which makes sense since the airline is partially owned by TATA). The only thing that I would say the lounge can improve on is having it's own free WIFI service like other lounges do. I didn't have an India sim card at the time and it was a little frustrating to only use the Airport wifi which has extremely limited service unless you pay for a premium and it is only enabled in a short amount of time. I hope this is implemented in the future. The flight itself was great and staff was very nice. I also think the plane should also have wifi and inflight entertainment to stay ahead in the domestic airline market in India. In America, many domestic airlines have WIFI onboard already. Other than those things I highly recommend flying Vistara after flying pretty much all Domestic airlines in India, if you have a long layover I also highly recommend paying for the Vistara lounge"

Good evening!!!

There was two bad experience with Visatara Family.
(1) We travelled 19 people from Delhi to Guhawati on date: 9th October 2016. In Checking time, it was too slow, we cannot explain for that,it took almost 30-35 mins only for getting our boarding pass.I think may be crew was new joining and because of that we were getting late for security checking and we couldn't even check our Bording pass, one of our member got different flight and She was travelling with her baby boy. It was shameless of you because we have already told that crew she was travelling with us and link that ticket with us. And because of late Checking we can not check flight number, why we cannot check?? Because we trusted you, we trust Vistara Family. Now we understand that never trust Vistara. MY PNR NO 4G0IFZ DELHI TO GAUHATI

On 11th October 2016, we were coming back to home From Guhawati to Ahmedabad. Also 19 people journey together but now this time, it was highly experienced with Priancy (air hostess of Vistara). Our family member Mr. Monil Zota open the luggage box , she was came and shut that box very badly and after that she argue with us that why you open the luggage box. We explain that a baby boy was crying, we getting some sancks for a baby boy after the explanation, she cannot find her fault, we told incharge crew, on that time she also argue I cannot do that, I shut that box slowly. If she shut that box slowly you can also cross check with other travellers and crew members also. After that she was very rude behaviour with us all the journey time. Now you tell us, why we should travel with you? Why?? Your crew member cannot be cooperative. You cannot do Group Checking as other airlines do and give us best priority for group checking. MY PNR NO 4GXDSY GAUHATI TO AHMEDABAD

After all over we are not going to travel with vistara Airline because it was too bad experience. And we thought that we are not going to travel with you, if you giving us free ticket, complimentary letter, Gifts etc. We cannot travel with you and also our friends and other family members. Thank you so much for such a Memorable and experience travelling. Thank you so mucH"
